"Axiom Verge 2 out now on Switch, PS4 and Epic Games Store (PS5 version at a later date)",11,2021-08-22T20:09:00Z,"Okay reading up on some lore stuff for both the first and second this is what I think the plot is all about: Spoiler Axiom Verge 2 is a prequel to the first. ""The Emergence"" is just Sudra (the planet from the first) from long before Athetos arrived. Drushka, the leader of the Kazahks in the Emergence, is referenced by name in logs in the first. ""Rusalki,"" the term for the computer beings from the first, comes from the Slavic term for a mermaid like being, the spirits of drowned women, rusalka (hence why Elsenova refers to herself as a water machine or something?). Drushka had the ability to go ""upstream"" in worlds, which have higher levels of technology. This is how the Rusalki and such were all created. The Trace you play as in the first is a clone of Athetos who could have come into existence at any time after Athetos released the pathogen. Trace did endure the blast that robbed him of his sight and left him crippled, but he did not end up in Sudra at that point. He developed the theory of everything with Hammond, and Hammond went on to create the ansibles and open up a way to Kiengir (the world from the second). But Trace/Athetos did not reach Sudra until after the events of Axiom Verge 2, and by that time the Rusalki were created. The ""home"" that Trace is sent to in the end of the first is a false one, a dream conjured up by the the Rusalki ""Veruska,"" who is referred to as ""The Dreamer"" who creates ""mind worlds"" (or at least the only Rusalki willing to admit it, whatever that means). This is why Athetos appears in the end and tells him to ""wake up."" Which is where Indra comes in. By the end of Axiom Verge 2, Indra has become a completely separate being from her original human form, which perishes holding off Amashilama in the end. She goes to Drushka to try to go ""upstream"" to find more powerful technology to help turn Arms like Damu back. She is now completely inorganic, no longer worries about going back to Earth, and is no longer willing to call herself ""Indra."" So what do Drushka and her find? Well, they likely created the Rusalki. And Indra herself likely *becomes* one of the Rusalki, specifically ""Ophelia."" One, her face as depicted in the end credits looks an awful lot like Ophelia's face in the first. Like I said before, rusalka can refer to the spirit of a drowned woman, and Ophelia is specifically the name of a character from Hamlet that died of drowning--and Indra dies at the beginning of Axiom Verge 2 by drowning. Ophelia also lacks the odd speech patterns that the other Rusalki with speaking roles have. So Indra worked with Drushka to go ""upstream"" and get the same technology the Lamassu used to help Kiengir fight their war against the Udug, which led to the creation of the Rusalki and everything on what is eventually called Sudra. At some point after this is when Trace/Athetos ends up in Sudra proper, which leads to the events of the first. I think this is the basic gist of everything I've seen people compile. Some things that don't have a clear answer that are just my speculation: The Lamassu seemed to be *something* that was created a really long time ago to prevent the travel up and downstream worlds. But by the time of the first game, the Rusalki now seem to have this same directive--Athetos fought against them and released the pathogen to gain access to the Breach, which I *think* is supposed to be the area between worlds? The ""Breach Attractor"" Athetos is using at the end of the first is a large version of the same upgrade you get in Axiom Verge 2. His goal was to use the Breach to move upstream so he could then bring this technology downstream to Earth. The other humans in Kiengir mutate after a certain point in the game, but why is not entirely clear. Apparently in the files of the game this is controlled by Indra passing by them after gaining the drone power, which starts a timer to their mutation. Is it possible that this is caused by the pathogen? If I may speculate, perhaps the pathogen was caused by the process that turned people into Arms on Kiengir, or maybe more specifically children like Damu into Arms, and this is why there are no more people left on the world outside of Arms. And this was discovered by Trace/Athetos on his way to Sudra? I dunno. Apologies if all this has been discussed here already, I just thought it was all pretty fascinating. I love the world building Happ has done, it's really wild.",2021,8

Blast from the past: Epic CEO: “You’re going to see lower prices” on Epic Games Store,1,2021-12-10T04:45:00Z,"Year 2019 Speaking to Ars Technica, though, Epic co-founder and CEO Tim Sweeney says that players should look forward to paying less on the Epic Games Store in the future. While Epic leaves pricing decisions completely in developers' hands, Sweeney said, ""after you go through several cycles of game developers making decisions, you're going to see lower prices as developers pass on the savings to customers, realizing they can sell more copies if they have a better price. ""This sort of economic competition is really healthy for the whole industry and will lead the industry to a better place for all developers and for gamers as well,"" he continued. ""It's a supply-side thing, this revenue sharing, it's some sort of business arrangement between developers and a store that [a] gamer generally doesn't see... [but] as developers reinvest more of that 18 percent of additional revenue into building better games, that's key to the long-term health of the game industry that we all have to look out for."" Epic CEO: “You’re going to see lower prices” on Epic Games Store Sweeney says free games, ""high quality standard"" are leading to quick growth. arstechnica.com Year 2022 And I would add that games on PC got more expensive in past 3 years due to publishers and developers dropping regional pricing and Epic Store exclusives mostly being available only on one store or with minimal or no discounts outside Epic Store if they popp up",2021,12

Epic Games Store Discussion,1,2018-12-12T18:08:00Z,"Their refunds policy is absolutely awful. 2 “no questions asked” refunds when you start your account (for purchases no more than 14 days old, with the chance to get an extra refund annually but no more than 2 refunds total per year) This is worse than just about every single one of their competitors. I made some examples in my thread about this: Origin offer what they call the ""Great Game Guarantee"", which gives allows you to refund an unlimited number of games, as long as it is before 14 days from the purchase date, or 24 hours after first opening it. However, you are not allowed to return the same game for a refund more than 2 times. Steam allows you to refund an unlimited number of games, as long as you haven't played it for more than 2 hours. Gog offer their ""Money Back guarantee"" , for technical problems faced within the first 30 days of purchase.

Epic Games Vs. Apple court case has begun,14,2021-05-04T07:06:00Z,"One interesting question is whether similar logic could be applied to enforcement of certification requirements, because those are *also* ways a hardware manufacturer can dictate what is permitted onto their system. Would the hardware manufacturer still be able to block content from a side store on the grounds that it breaks certification? If not, that opens a *whole* other kettle of fish. One thing that's been danced around a bit - and I'm going to be very interested to hear the court's discussion on the subject - is how all this applies to monetising Free to Play titles specifically - they still need to be tested and certified, and theironlyavenue for monetisation is through in-game transactions. In one of Epic's earlier missives they suggested a way Apple could still get a reasonable fee for that without in-game transaction fees, and it'sterrible: That's one big concern about this for me, because one side-effect of such a practice would be effectively pulling Epic pulling the ladder up behind them and stopping small companies who couldn't afford such a thing from making thenextbig free-to-play hit. There needs to be a better solution, so I'm very interested to see how that is approached in the court. Edit: Oh, wait.

Epic launches digital games store with 88% revenue going to developers,1,2018-12-04T10:03:00Z,"Epic Launches Digital Games Store With 88 Percent Revenue Going To Developers Epic Games, developer of titles like Fortnite, the first Gears of War trilogy, and Unreal Tournament, has announced the creation of a new digital PC store that hopes to compete with Steam by offering an unprecedented revenue split for developers. The Epic Games Store is launching as a full-fledged game marketplace supporting all sorts of titles. The Fortnite developer hopes to incentivize developers to come over to the Epic Games Store by pushing the revenue split for software further than any platform holder has before, giving developers 88 percent of the revenues while keeping 12 percent for overhead. This is a big change considering the traditional industry standard for digital revenue split usually gives 30 percent to the store owner, whether it be Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, Apple, Android, or Valve. Perhaps anticipating this move, Valve recentlymade adjustments to Steam's revenue model, but only above certain thresholds that most games won't hit. “As a developer ourselves, we have always wanted a platform with great economics that connects us directly with our players,” Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said in a press statement. “Thanks to the success of Fortnite, we now have this and are ready to share it with other developers.” The absurd amount of money that Fortnite makes every dayclearly allowed Epic to invest the money into making this more developer-friendly store. The company also made this changewith its Unreal asset store earlier this year, again citing the massive profits from Fortnite as the reason they can afford a thinner profit off store purchases. Another prong of Epic's developer-friendly approach is waiving all Unreal Engine royalty fees for revenue generated on the store. If a developer's game uses UE4, copies sold on Epic's store don't give a separate percentage to Epic, encouraging developers and publishers to direct their fans to the Epic Game Store and buy there. To get anywhere close to the same revenue split on Steam, a creator would have to make $50 million in revenue on Steam alone before getting to an 80/20 split, with engine fees still on top.

Because you already have to use it for UE4 development, specifically if you want to buy assets, andit's awful. It's so slow and clunky. Like, for example, just browsing the marketplace in UE4 -- there's no option for a list view. You HAVE to scroll through the market with big icons like this, you can't even shrink them or change the number of icons per page. Even basic stuff, like changing pages, is the very last option on their market page. It's at the bottom, so no, you can't just flip through pages quickly, you have to scroll through each one. Visibility options? You can see what's on sale, what's new... that's basically it But surely your library is different, right? Oh wait, no, even less options.

Epic Store 2021 Year in Review,1,2022-01-27T11:17:00Z,"For comparison last year results Spoiler: 2020 With 2022 underway, we can look back on the last year of the Epic Games Store and share what happened along the way. Just as we didlast year, we've looked at all of the data and gathered it together for a retrospective. The Epic Games Store continued to grow in 2021 and we're excited about what we have in store for 2022. We're proud to be part of a growing community of developers, publishers, players, and creators who made 2021 another humbling year for us. There are now over 194 million Epic Games Store PC users, an increase of 34M from 2020. Daily active users peaked at 31.1M, and peak concurrent users reached 13.2M. December's monthly active users peak reached 62M users, an increase of 11% from last year's peak of 56M. Players bought more games and played them for longer in 2021. We now have 917 titles for sale on the Epic Games Store, nearly doubling what we had available to customers in 2020. About $840M was spent through the store in 2021, up 20% from 2020. Third-party games represented 36% of all sales with more than $300M in player spending, a 12% increase from 2020. We continued to give away free games each week. Many developers and publishers collaborated with us over the year to give away 89 free games worth $2,120. Over 765 million free games were claimed by players, bringing those titles to a new audience. 76 free games broke their peak concurrent user records on PC, with an average of 13 times their all-time records! That's incredible engagement. This year's holiday sale was bigger than ever. Over 31M people participated in the event, snagging over 159 million items during the event, a 14% increase over Holiday Sale 2020. If you played a game from the Epic Games Store in 2021, you were part of a community that spent 6.2 billion hours in-game. We hope you had fun. Shipped Store Features in 2021 By far the most anticipated feature for the store was theShopping Cart, which we released in December. Players can now have up to 50 items in their cart at any moment. We also shippedEpic Achievementsand added an Achievements Profile Page for players to track their progress. So far, 25 titles have added achievement support. In addition, we also made the following updates: Updated navigation to easily find everything the Epic Games Store has to offer as well as a new way to quickly launch into your most recently played games. Social Panel improvements with improved Presence to see what your friends are playing. New views for discovery of New Releases, Top Sellers and Coming Soon as well as Categories/Genres for products on the store. Improved Wishlist support with optional email notifications to never miss when your next favorite game is available. Added Epic Games wallet for US & Canadian customers, letting players load money directly into their Epic Games account, allowing for quick and easy payments. Improved product pages that allow more information and media to be reviewed prior to adding to wishlist or adding to cart. New Epic Games Store Newsletter Email (sign up in your profile settings). Support for 43 currencies, with 13 new currencies added in 2021. Developer and Publisher Improvements Coming in 2022 Last year, we talked about improving the Epic Games Store's publishing tools, with the desire to eventually provide complete self-publishing tools to developers and publishers using the platform. We took a huge step in that direction in August when we launched our Publishing Tools in a successfulclosed Beta. We welcomed hundreds of new titles to the Epic Games Store in our Closed Alpha and Closed Beta Programs for these new Self Publishing tools. Epic Games Store partners can expect a full release in 2022, which will make the process of launching a game on the store more efficient and seamless. Players on Epic Games Store will benefit by having more great games to choose from as we continue to grow the catalog of games available on the store. Other key partner updates this year include Developer Portal improvements and PC Store Cross Play courtesy of Epic Online Services. PC Store Cross Play will make it easier than ever to launch a multiplayer PC game across multiple PC stores including Steam, Epic Games Store, Windows Store, GOG and more!

Epic Store and 12% cut,1,2019-04-08T15:39:00Z,"Big point that Epic is using for pushing their Store (beside exclusives) is 12%/88% split. That really is amazing and it is great for developers. But (there is always but in life) unfortunately that 12% doesn't come for free. In this case it comes for free for developers and Epic but customers who decide to use payment methods that are not ""industry norm"" , according to Epic, Will need to cover payment fees. As you can see Epic is not hiding that. Now let's see how high those fees. Based on supported payment methods they could range from 5 to 7% And then we have cases for yet unsupported methods that can go up to 25% Then we have info from Valve presented at this years GDC where they revealed that almost 90% payments in Asia alone come from non standard payment methods. Unfortunately they didn't reveal exact cut but Valve supports over 100 payment methods so fees for those probably vary a lot. What we know is that one of the more popular payment methods in Asia is cash, and specially Steam Wallet Cards (we have data only for Asia but from roaming around the reddit and forums you can notice that it is very popular payment method in many other countries where PayPal or CC is not used that much). And those cards as you can see cost Valve 10-15% (as far as i know that is more-less standard rate for any Wallet Card). So based on this data Epic Store simply can't afford to include some of these payment methods with 12% cut and as we can see many markets ask for those payment methods (please watch Valve GDC presentation about doing business in emerging markets). So as you can see that is one example of what it costs to lower Store cut that much. But there is another one. Second thing are 3rd party key sellers like GMG, Humble Bundle, Voidu, Fanatical... And this has 2 things attached to itself. First thing is that at 12% Epic needs all money they can get to run a store, but if games from Epic Store are sold elsewhere for lower price (3rd party key sellers can lower their cut even more) and they are selling well (based on Steam Reviews for recent big games 20-50% Reviews are coming from users who bought game outside Steam) they could be in trouble. If 30% of total buyers buy game outside of Epic Store technically Epic is getting 8%. And according toTim Sweeneythat is enough to cover costs, but if you are running business you need profit. So Epic has a choice either to start charging developers for keys as they are doing for now limit sales to one store (Humble Bundle) or don't allow sales outside their store. Second thing regarding 3rd party key sellers is actual discount. Right now that 30% cut allows many 3rd party key sellers to drop the price up to 25% for pre-orders and day 1 purchases. That of course attracts huge amount of customers and as we could see before that is something that Epic really can't afford to allow. So as consequence if those stores get to sell Epic Store keys they will probably be limited how big discounts they can offer (something like GMG and their PlayStation offers that are max 7% off if i remember correctly). As you can see 12% really is awesome deal for developers but it comes with huge cost for many customers. As much as it is great to support developers customers will in most cases look themselves first (that is their right after all). And this could lead to potential issue. But that doesn't mean that Valve can't lower their cut(as we could see they can and they did based on amount of money game generated). But even that can be improved, they probably still have a bit more room to do something. But based on data we have today 12% that Epic asks for is not good middle ground between developer needs and what customers are looking for. If mods thing that this is not worth discussing or that i didn't covered it well, feel free to lock the thread.",2019,4

"Epic Store Minimum Guarantees initiative was largely a failure, Epic moving to Publishing deals on multiple platforms to get better ROI",1,2021-12-20T04:15:00Z,"Yet when we covered lawsuit document takeaways back in May, we believed that financial realities were catching up with EGS: ""We believe that EGS 'minimum guarantee' deals are winding down. The catalog is widening, and many more publishers/devs have been let onto the Epic Games Store to publish games with no exclusivity, but no advance."" And.. we now have proof of this, at least as of mid-2020, thanks to some late November official court document updates spotted on Reddit. Surprised to see new, interesting data crop up after the trial concluded. The Reddit post only mentioned a fraction of the full doc, but here's what got our attention: So yes, minimum guarantees from Epic have been dialed way down. And from the existing Epic Games Store games that got upfront MG $ and launched by mid-2020, there's interesting data, too. We particularly noted the below slide, showing it's the smaller games (minimum guarantee <$10 million) recouping particularly badly - at 20% of lifetime forecast: More at link: Real data: inside Epic's plans for Epic Games Publishing The Apple vs. Epic trial serves up one last data iceberg. newsletter.gamediscover.co",2021,12

Even with lower prices, unless they are a crazy deal, consumers will bake in the price of convenience of not having to change their platforms etc. For eg., I have a PS5 just for Sony exclusives. How much lower would Sony have to price third party games for me not to get them on Xbox or PC? I would say it should be about 25% or more.

Ghost Recon Breakpoint will skip Steam for Epic Games Store,1,2019-05-10T17:40:00Z,"Ghost Recon Breakpoint will skip Steam for Epic Games Store Per GamesIndustry.biz and PCGamesN ​ I don't recall seeing a thread on this, but I think it's worth making as this alongside Anno seem to be the next step of the Ubisoft and Epic Games partnership that they announced a few months ago. This seems to be working out well for Ubisoft going by the article so I don't see this trend of their games skipping Steam for EGS dying any time soon. Ghost Recon Breakpoint will be the next major Ubisoft release to skip Steam in favour of the Epic Games Store, the publisher has told PCGamesN. The first Ubisoft release to do so was Tom Clancy's The Division 2, in a move the publisher announced in January this year. At that point, it was considered a coup for the Epic Games Store, surpassing Metro Exodus as the biggest game to bypass Steam. Since the launch of The Division 2 in March, Anno 1800 has also been exclusive to the Epic Games Store. Ghost Recon Breakpoint, which was announced yesterday, will be the third major Ubisoft release out of three to bypass Steam. Speaking to investors after its Q3 results, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot acknowledged the ""growing number of distribution platforms fighting for great content"" in the games industry. ""With this deal, we saw an opportunity to increase player exposure to our own store while at the same time supporting a partner that greatly values our games and provides better terms,"" he said. ""Early indications are supportive, as PC pre-orders are higher than for the first Division, and pre-orders on the Ubisoft store are six times higher. We believe this deal is a long-term positive for Ubisoft."" While The Division and Ghost Recon are undoubtedly AAA franchises, they are not in the very top-tier of Ubisoft IP. It remains to be seen whether the publisher will skip Steam with the next major installments of Far Cry and Assassin's Creed.",2019,5

I've been troubleshooting why everything was stuttering so much for me and finally diagnosed that as the root cause. G-Sync on: G-Sync off: 60 FPS limit on + vsync on (inexplicably labeled ""Refresh Rate"" in the settings) + G-Sync off has produced the most consistent frame rate and frame times for me. After turning G-sync off, there's been no more stuttering. High frame rate seems to be imperfect, at least in Kingdom Hearts I. Any time the camera would look at the waterfalls in Destiny Islands the game would instantly lock to 60 FPS; if I turned the camera away it would jump back to 144. It's pretty bizarre. I haven't played very far through the ports yet so I don't know what else might crop up, so I'm staying at 60 FPS just in case. If you unlock the frame rate but cap it with an external tool, some things might actually slow down and feel sluggish, particularly on the PC settings menus and launcher, at least in my experience. Also, the in-game FPS limiter with vsync off causes frame time stuttering for me too; this doesn't happen with vsync on, which is why I'd suggest keeping it on as well. I'm not sure if anybody else is having these specific circumstances but if so I hope this can help.",2021,3

Game looks PHENOMINAL, even better than it did on X1X. I'm playing on all Max with the exception of Shadows / AO being on High and it is just gorgeous.

New court filing shows Epic has lost more than $450 Million on the EGS in the past 2 years and other interesting facts,1,2021-04-09T12:35:00Z,"This new court filing is a very lengthy read at over 300 pages but there are some interesting bits of information: Currently EGS has more than 160 million registered users and more than 56 million monthly active users EGS has 400 games published by more than 200 developers EGS currently supports 29 different currencies and has pricing in more than 190 countries and 30 regions EPIC expects EGS to become profitable in 2023 At present, EGS has not yet achieved profitability because it has increased a lot of costs in order to gain market share The 12% distribution amount charged by EGS is sufficient to cover the operating costs of EGS EPIC lost approximately US$181 million on EGS in 2019, approximately US$273 million in 2020, and estimated losses of approximately US$139 million in 2021 Apple uses the application review process to give priority to its own applications to pass the review, and use this to compete against competitors Apple does not use all its own rules for its own apps There's also this useful bit of information: This suggests that most EGS exclusives aren't selling very well if they aren't hitting their minimum sales guarantees. Personally I think EGS being profitable by 2023 is being very optimistic unless they seriously plan on cutting back on exclusives and freebies, and even then I have serious doubts that people picking up free games or being forced to buy from the EGS are going to buy stuff on EGS over other superior storefronts/platforms.

Some games on Epic Store can cost up to 300% more compared to Steam for dozens of millions of users (regional pricing issues),1,2018-12-08T20:44:00Z,"""It's just another launcher you need to install and open."" No, it's not. Let me explain. I personally don't care if I have to install and launch another launcher, what I care the most is whether I can afford the games or not. I actually have other launcher installed, such as B.Net, Uplay, and Origin. And it's perfectly fair if they want to lock their first party games into their store, as you can see from Blizzard and EA doing with their launcher. I can also buy them from 3rd party key sellers which will make them cheaper than buying directly from the store. But what Epic doing is not exactly that, they're taking away 3rd party games that were meant to be released in other stores and make them their store exclusive, with no way to buy them other than from their store as there's no feature to register a game key. Now to the matter at hand. We live in a global world, there are many other countries and regions outside of US and EU, including my country Indonesia. In the past several years, Steam has been positively supporting these countries with local currency support, Steam wallet cards, and regional pricing. This has been a blessing especially for my country. Buying games are easier and cheaper than ever. I can actually go to a minimarket to buy Steam games with cash, or buy them via local 3rd party sellers, and so on. Steam has successfully convince many of us to buy games instead of pirating them nowadays. Legit video game market here is actually a thing now. Tbf, Epic does support local payment for my country. However, there's a huge problem. As it's in USD, I'll have to pay for this amount for Shadow Complex Remastered: Now, let's take a look at how much does it cost on Steam: ""But that's an already released game, how do I know that it'll be the same for other games?"" Here's why. This game is already out on Steam: The publisher switched to Epic store to release their next game exclusively, and here's what it cost: Essentially more than 3x times than on Steam. Now you probably see my point here. This is only the start. There are still more games with ""Coming Soon"" status on Epic store. Some of them are already released on Steam with pretty reasonable regional pricing, including Darksiders III and Subnautica, among others. Darksiders is $60 but actually cheaper than Hello Neighbor on Epic store, it's only $30 (converted from IDR) on Steam. Imagine how would it cost on Epic Store, yes it's gonna be Rp 872.000. Another thing about currency support and regional pricing, Steam is not the only one that's reinforcing it. Some other stores on PC have it, even though none of them as robust as Steam. As of now, Steam supportsalmost 40 currenciesaround the world, and some of them can be applied to multiple countries. And it's not only a thing in PC gaming. In console space Sony also have a robust regional pricing support. I believe that's one of the main reason why the Playstation 4 got a huge success worldwide, unlike the other consoles. Tbf, Microsoft also offer regional pricing and currency, even though not as good as Sony. As you can see below, $60 cost roughly $50 if converted to IDR. ""Cool, so it does affect consumers positively, but what can regional pricing offer to publishers?"" Let's hear it fromSergey Galyonkin the SteamSpy guywho's hired by Epic himself: Regional pricing Steam advises setting local pricing for some markets with lower GDP per capita — mostly BRIC and developing countries. Please, follow its advice, because it matters a lot. For example, Russians and Chinese are infamous for pirating games and if you check geo stats for some games you’ll see that these countries aren’t buying much. Except when your game is priced according to expectations in this region (and localized properly, but that’s a topic for another post). An average share of China in paid games is around 1%, but for GTA V it’s 10% — and we’re talking about 250 thousand additional copies sold because of the right price. The same is true for Russia — Russians can buy up to 18% of your game copies if you price, localize and market it right. Effectively you can double your sales and increase your revenue by up to 50% if you cater to the most important markets outside US and Europe. So that's that. By moneyhatting the games to Epic store, they don't only take them away from consumers from many regions in the world, but also might negatively impact the devs/publishers. I hope people can understand the frustration some of us are having with the recent move by Epic. I'm all for competition, but not like this. We're all consumers here, so let's take this issue from consumers perspective.",2018,12

Pre-orders for The Division 2 on the Epic Games Store are now live for the standard, gold, and ultimate editions of the game. In its press release of the announcement of this news, Ubisoft says the two companies are working together to ""integrate key components of Ubisoft’s Uplay and Epic’s online services,"" which likely means buying the game on the Epic store will work similarly to how buying a Ubisoft game on Steam works now, including being able to access Uplay no matter what store you buy it on.

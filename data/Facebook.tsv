Facebook	Monica	2018-07-19T12:29:22Z	1	Facebook is actually dangerous. I had a life threating messages from some psycho, reported it to facebook, which I had to do three times and they’ve done absolutely nothing about the obviously fake profile. All I got was automatic responses regarding how to block that scum, even though I’ve already told them I blocked him straight away. It’s bad for business as well. I’ve used their advertising at very small fee once, after that I had no organic growth at all, even though I had it before I advertised! Which makes me conclude they happily blocked any organic growth on my page so I keep paying them for advertising which lead to actual less growth on my business page. And of course, recent changes do not show my business page posts to users anyway. I find it dangerous and absolutely useless for new businesses. Don’t invest your time.
Facebook	Andrea Green	2018-07-17T12:54:46Z	1	I've had a great experience using the marketplace but they continue to block me for reasons unknown for items that I've posted that shouldn't be blocked or appealed. With that being said they have left open appeals that should not have been Appeals and now they continue to block me three times in the last couple of weeks saying I have too many things posted that violate the policies. One item was a ring one was a kid's game one was it vase and so on.Seems that a computer is doing this and they need to have a person, a human being look at what's going on so it can be fixed.Yesterday they told me I'm permanently removed it's so unfair. I've spoken to a few other sellers they said they've never heard of this before being a problem like this especially when you didn't post anything violating the policies.There's no customer service support. They launched this to the public and to the buyers and the sellers and they have no support as far as customer service goes. Provide some coaching Facebook and share what is going on so it can be corrected that seems like the fair thing to do if you truly feel certain things should be posted and there seems to be confusion.please share why it says that your appeal will be reviewed within 24 hours and then it's still sitting there since the beginning of May and do to your lack of reviewing the appeals that I've been blocked.too bad that you shove the good people under the rug and allow so many other things to go on on Facebook very sad.

Facebook	Carol Reddin	2018-07-16T13:13:55Z	1	Facebook allow scam sites to advertise on social media pages.Facebook ignore people reporting scam sites.Facebook constantly allow lululike to advertise on my page telling me me friends like lululike when this is not true.Facebook got me to trust lululike by telling me my friends like lululike.HOW IS THIS ALLOWED?WHY ARE FB NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT THESE SCAM SITES?Is it because fb are receiving revenue from the ad clicks etc ?

Facebook	scottish785	2018-07-12T22:29:36Z	1	"Facebook can't be trusted at all!Again I saw a page I follow closed merely cause the liberal idiots that run facistbook take down anything they personally disagree with while hateful groups that are on the left side of the political spectrum are allowed to remain and fester their own breed of hatred!Good example there is a group on facistbook called ""May God make the Activist Mommy Spontaneously Combust""the group before changing their name was called ""I will find Activist Mommy and burn whoever runs it alive""Now to any sane person these would be threats of violence directed at another member on Facistbook but here was their reply to my report-------------------------Thanks for your report - you did the right thing by letting us know about this. We looked over the group you reported, and though it doesn't go against one of our specific Community Standards, we understand that the group or something shared in it may still be offensive to you. We want to help you avoid things you don't want to see on Facebook.""-------------------------it goes on with how to block them and such.Another group still alive is a group titled ""Cliven Bundy Must Die""See it seems so long as the hate group is left leaning they can spew whatever they want on Facistbook but let a group like Britain First start a group and within 24 hours the page is taken down for no good reason!Facistbook has no business being in business if they want to trash half their users because of political beliefs.I personally am winding down my use of Facistbook and moving elsewhere to a website that can be trusted as Facistbook has lost the trust of this user!"

Facebook	review	2018-07-05T19:04:42Z	2	"facebook is a social networking site. good or bad, privacy or no privacy.My issue comes with the ""customer support"", or lack of. Most companies have *some way* of letting you contact them. Most companies wouldn't exist without some sort of customer support option. Facebook has absolutely no way of letting you contact them if you have a problem. Their customer support is you asking the facebook community a question.This means if your profile gets deleted, you have absolutely no way of getting any human assistance. There is an 'appeal' page. Which doesn't work.Our house, our rules. No human customer support. facebook is a typical modern silicon valley muppet company."

Facebook	gosh	2018-07-02T15:38:34Z	1	It is really not a good idea to use Facebook for business or even any real grown up interaction with people. I have been blocked from using my account for 24 hours now and have no idea if it will be made available to me again or not. I know what I did to cause this; I opened my Facebook account twice on my browser on the same computer, I can understand for security purposes this needs to be looked into, but to take days about it is nothing less than pathetic!If and when I get back into my account I shall be making sure that from now on that I do no serious business through it and most certainly will not be running ads or promoting anything that costs me money.
Facebook	Matthew Vernon	2018-07-02T03:03:33Z	1	Facebook is a good form of soical mediaThe reason its 1 star is several years ago my account stopped getting push notificationsSo spoke to FB ther answer was its was my phone anyway several years later and 6 phones later it is still the same if people comments or like my things i dnt know unless i go on to the app. Now when im selling something on the marketplace this gets very annoying because if im not glued to the phone i dnt know when people are intresting in buying..Anyway a few yrs later i complain again and ther  ew response was close my account and recreate a other. If i close my account ill love about 14 years worth of posts status and general banter inc the daily yearly reminders which has alot with my kids upbringing its little reminders of things ive forgotten.Ive asked for them to reset or transfer everything over but they do not care so for this its 1 star

Facebook	User	2018-07-01T06:43:10Z	1	"Absolutely pathetic!!! My Animals fan page got deleted after a couple of scumbags Miyuki Valerie Okada aka Bird with a character, and Seven Dunbar started filing fraudulent copyright reports on videos that were posted WITH PERMISSION from the real owners! These scumbags used fake profiles and fake email address for every report! I tried everything to get Facebook to see that the reports were fake, I sent screenshots of conversations I had with the owners and I even got the owners to contact Facebook to tell them about the fraudulent reports but Facebook rejected them or wouldn't even respond!!! Also Miyuki Valerie Okada who owns the page called ""Bird with a character"" steals peoples photos and meme's and crops out or overwrites their watermarks with her OWN! She then files fraudulant copyright reports on anyone that uses the original photo!!! The photo she STOLE! She was so jealous of my page and many other pages so she files fraudulent copyright reports on them and gets them shut down! And there's no way to contact Facebook about this problem and even if you manually file a counter claim they tell you to contact the person who made the report! Everything on Seven Dunbar's pages is also stolen content and he to files fraudulent copyright reports even did it to a lady who had lost her child and was trying to find her daughter! I truely hope that people stop using Facebook!!! Money hungry grubs!"

Facebook	Matthew Bowles	2018-06-26T22:17:10Z	1	I made a fair reasoned comment against a company I had a bad experience with and rated them on their Facebook page. I was not rude, aggressive or abusive and asked for a response. I was then locked out of my Facebook account and when I eventually managed to get back in I found my review had been deleted. I then queried this with Facebook and receive no response.
Facebook	Mommaof3	2018-06-26T18:24:49Z	1	I’ve had a Facebook since Facebook was even a thing. Recently a post was made concerning an ongoing court case. The details in the post were sexual and not appropriate for the common age on Facebook, not to mention it included names of children under the age of 10. This post was also degrading a human and considered defamation of character in the eyes of an attorney. I personally know it was reported to Facebook at least 100 times as harassment and Facebook never took it down. The social media sight feeds on negativity of the world.

Also problems responding to friends questions letters flashing moving up and down! Good for finding friends family etc sometimes you put personal stuff in then regret it later. Anyone starting my advice be careful what you say might come back and haunt you. For example telling people your going on holiday burglars' would like that!
Facebook	Christian Marriott	2018-06-21T20:08:58Z	1	I have spend a small amount of money advertising on farcebook, but when I tried to scale it up I hit a payment issue (my visa card expired) leaving me owing farcebook a tiny amount of money ($7.60) there crappy website won'r allow me to add a new card because my account is now suspended because I owe money... It seems that I can't reactivate the account until I pay them, and I can't add my new payment card because the account is suspended until I do pay them.... Wasted several hours trying to resolve this, and there isn't even anyone that I can phone....  My now multi million pound company advertises pretty much everywhere else other than farcebook...

Facebook	mojo jojo	2018-06-13T23:13:47Z	1	Ever since day one Facebook has been a negative thing for me.  It seem almost nothing good comes from it.  Even using the groups, I tried to sell some things thru a virtual store twice and it was rejected when i was selling something hard earned and honest nothing illegal or inappropriate perhaps because I am pro life, as ceo's of facebook have donated to the abortion giant planned parenthood a racist and baby killing organization.  I sometimes suspect and have herd that facebook follows people and if they don't agree with something you post they shut you out and censor you give you a hard time.  I think facebook is the one that should be shutdown ,boycotted.
Facebook	Doug Robinson	2018-06-11T17:13:19Z	1	Facebook is an untrustworthy organisation and isn't even GDPR-compliant as far as I can see. The only way to tell them to stop tracking me is to create an account. They do not have my permission to collect and/or share my data but they don't seem to care about the law.I hope they get fined; 4% of global turnover should make them think again.

Facebook	SJ Cor Ignis	2018-06-05T08:47:25Z	1	I placed an honest 1 star review of a company onto FB. Someone (not saying it was the company I was reviewing) reported my 1 star review of poor customer service in store and I had a message from FB asking for a re-set as suspicious activity had been detected. When I went back to the page of the company I had reviewed my review was gone and I was unable to resubmit as FB just said Posting Failed! I have messaged FB twice for an explanation and received no response. It is totally unethical for ratings of a company with poor service to be manipulated so that customers cannot make an informed decision. I understand that other reviewers have had the same thing happen to them!

When I unwrapped it I was gobsmacked at its cheap tacky look and it was not what I originally ordered. I contacted the company who agreed to have it back. But now they are ignoring my messages and phone calls. Has anyone else had a similar situation and was it resolved. Please forward this to as many people as possible let’s get rid of this type of con artist. I can’t believe fb let people like this to sites on their page
Facebook	C	2018-06-04T10:33:49Z	1	"In 2018 it's hard to still see the value in Facebook outside of it being a means of staying in touch with people you barely spoke to in the first place. When people aren't waxing lyrical about how terrible the hand they've been dealt is, they're showing themselves off in the best possible light through the use of carefully chosen pictures which nine times out of ten, has a filter applied. One could lead you to believe that they had life of grandeur and never-ending love when in actuality it's an existence of trying to look good in the eyes of others and nothing more. A sad reality for many.Detoxing from Facebook after an admittedly severe addiction has been similar to that of when a Pornstar finds Christ, it opens up a world of time, energy and freedom you never knew you had and brings to light just how damaging social media can be and whilst Facebook can be and is great for keeping in touch with people, the truth is… So is a phone call. In 2018, Facebook stands as a hive-mind of narcism and negativity ran by the poster child of humanoid reptilians himself, Mark Zuckerberg. If you love the notion of stroking your ego and wallowing in the self pity and overblown grandeur of others then you may find solace in the never-ending disaster that is Facebook. You'll connect with friends, friends of friends and that one guy who you avoid at work but add for the simple fact that it makes you seem more popular, the fun never ends and years from now when humanity is even more self absorbed than before, where ""likes"" and ""follows"" are a legitimate currency and modern trends are as fickle and ill-thoughtout as the UK government, we'll have Facebook to primarily thank. If nothing more look at Jesus, he detoxed from social media for an entire lifetime and managed to walk on water AND resurrect himself.Just think of what you could achieve in that time."

Her number got changed and she forgot her password. She also set her email up a long time ago and forgot the password to that certain email. After explaining this to the Facebook support dude he informed me that her account was flagged for bad things and that I could get her account back for 300-500 dollars by having it secured so that her info would never be released. When I said I wasn’t going to pay 300-500 for her account to be unlocked he stated that I was a “ bad friend” because I wouldn’t help her pay to have her account unlocked. I was told I valued money over her. She later was able to get back onto her Facebook and there was no unusual activity as the Facebook support Indian had mentioned. Doesn’t deserve a rating. Facebook tried to scam me. Either that or the employee did.

And that my friend is no different than a highschool gossip group. Educate people to not believe everything they see or read without verifying the validity.

It is because of Facebook that by 2030, 1% of the entire population will own 99% of all money in the world. FACT: Facebook sells your data.FACT: Facebook get your data by reading your private messages.FACT Facebook listens to your conversations you make on your phone outside of the Facebook app.FACT: Facebook avoid paying TAX or VAT at the full due amount.FACT: Facebook has a smaller workforce than Amazon or Google and yet has more profiles than any other network or online business.FACT: Facebook undertakes experiments without your consent. One such experiment in Canada caused mass suicides.Facebook is destroying the small business, the starter business and any hope for entrepreneurs by taking 100% advertising revenue without offering monetization.FACT: Mark Zuckerberg should be in jail and Facebook should be destroyed as it is operating illegally in so many ways!
Facebook	JimmyThunder	2018-05-05T09:58:37Z	1	Facebook community standards are a joke and Facebook appear to be above the law when it comes to security and control.  A great idea, catastrophically executed with only one real outcome - legislation.  Adverts are boring and inappropriate, format is dated and if you have too many friends posting you never see the posts as they scroll too quickly.  And if you want to contact them?  Forget it.  No response other than stock responses saying the same thing.  Take it for what it is - a way of sharing photos with your family and friends when you are away.  Not much good for anything else.

Facebook	James Stretten	2018-04-21T17:16:55Z	1	Why everyone thinks this idiot platform is so omnipotent I don't know. It's useless and I cannot see how it's a threat to anyone! The interface is ludicrously over-complicated and clunky. You cannot contact ANYONE for assistance. It has patronising little articles about issues you are not experiencing, saying things like 'Hey, is this your prablem' (deliberate spelling).I have tried to simply boost a post recently and I repeatedly got an idiot message that says in an American accent 'Sorry, but we're having trouble boosting your post and are working to solve the problem. Please try again.’.Apparently you cannot phone them, email them or anything. I don't even know where they are. Google has a policy of penalising websites that don't carry a phone number (you know that old fashioned thing where you phone somebody and they talk to you?). So if Facebook hasn't got a PHONE number then it should be penalised by Google surely?I would love to see an end to the stupid thing.

Facebook	Jan	2018-04-14T19:54:29Z	1	Facebook is the creepiest invention from this millennium. This online 'social' network is to a large extend shielded from the rest of the open internet, like a dark web community. Facebook wants you. You have to be a member of their elite network, uploading your real photo and completing your profile in order to view the majority of it. Unfortunately most people of my age and even many older folks that I know are not so smart; they are FB members. They feel the need to eat this 'free lunch' and share photo's of their relationships, kids, holidays, important life events, like this and that, answer where they've studied, fill in where they grew up etc. Even my (questionable?) physician and former teachers are now part of this network, sharing photo's of their private lives. What they don't (want to) understand is that FB is not a free service. These people trade a social network service for everything they upload on FB. These people don't care or don't know that FB's intention is to sell all member data to governments, institutions and businesses around the globe. These people want to be slaves of the system, they want to be manipulated in the surveillance state that this world is increasingly becoming, thanks to mass data hoarding. They want to wake up in a system where their insurance is going to say: ''hey Kyle, I recently read your FB post about fitness, how about we give you a discount on your premium?'' and ''hey Tailor, you haven't been so transparent these recent months online, how about we increase your premium?''. Or how about Taylor's ex partner or unsatisfied customer who decides it's time to ruin her life forever online? These attention seekers want that world. And you know what? They will get it one day, but then it's too late..

Facebook	Sabyasachi	2018-04-10T13:26:42Z	1	Make no mistake, this has to be the worst company in the history of our planet (even worse than the British East India Company). Facebook has zero respect for privacy, people's wellbeing or democracy. All it cares is how to make the most money. Ads, Ads, Ads, Ads. It optimises and cares ONLY for ads. ONLY for money.It is not a social networking website. It is a surveillance and ads website.

Soon to encourage uploading of personal stuff soon and dialing back ads. But it's a scam to get more info to sell as no one is uploading much info anymore so it's running out of info to sell. Tbh delete and avoid like the plague, they deserve what comes to them with a they've done. Plus they've ruined the Internet and all the blogs Etc... everything used to thrive on the Internet till they dominated everything.
Facebook	Bill Busi	2018-04-05T15:46:27Z	1	I have no empathy whatsoever concerning Facebook's current woes.  Let me be blunt... Mark Zuckerberg is a fcukin a-hole. I closed my Facebook account a few months before all hell broke loose about Cambridge Analyitica.  I never had any respect for Zuckerberg but, I used Facebook anyway. I knew he was a jerk from the get go and yet I still opened an account on his,as it turns out, even more nightmarish and far more exploitive website than anyone had imagined. I guess like everybody else I wanted an easy and convenient way to keep in touch with old friends, acquaintances and family. Like most everybody I had no idea how much privacy I was giving up and I didn't know how much information about me Zuckerberg was selling to any company in the world who wanted to sell or exploit myself and my friends and family.  I wish I had never set up a Facebook page at all,but I'm glad that I closed my account and believe it or not, there is life without Facebook.   Anyway, lesson learned...never trust a scumbag like Zuckerberg and be more vigilant with any other social media sites you use.  And one final note : Don't even think for a moment that Zuckerberg will change his spots when all is said and done. Like I said at the beginning of this review... Mark Zuckerberg is a fcukin a-hole!

Mostly of us order stuff online ( thats bit i hate ) its tell me we all lazy and some of shops shutting down. No its not government fault. Its all your fault. Let me explain. Somethings you want you could went to shop and got it in 5mins. You decision not to and rather order online and you wont get it in post next 2days. Idiot's. Which is why i miss blockbusters very much and its was easy.  And first thing i have to say facebook is rubbish at all. Newsfeed is rubbish its old date. Nothing new and ive tried refresh.  And i saw my daughter on facebook she only 9. She had it account from she was 5years old. How could mother let her? I keep message facebook and they closed her account but its keep coming back with new account im so sick of it. And customer service rubbish and ive email mark co founder and no reply. I think facebook should be banned for under 18. End of

We reported her to Facebook many times and their response was to block her. Really don’t you think we did that. However I post a cage to sell on the marketplace and it is not breaking any policy and I am banned and no chance to get back on. So all and all you can stalk someone and their family but don’t try to sell a cage.

Facebook	Sara J	2018-03-18T09:37:28Z	1	Facebook is unsafe for so many reasons because to police their site correctly would involve high costs even now they have trouble policing the sea of effectively anonymous content produced by 2 billion users, and the unknown number of which are bots and paid trolls. The obvious solution is to enforce Facebook’s user policy (which says people can only post under their real names) and hold them responsible for what they publish. But that would cause Facebook’s user base to shrink, which would alarm investors. Also Facebook just doesn’t care about your kids. That’s pretty obvious — again 14th March 2018 , it came out that Facebook, in a poll, asked users if pedophiles should be able to ask kids for sexual pictures. Facebook backtracked after this news came out — saying the question was a “mistake.
Facebook	Eric	2018-03-17T16:39:23Z	4	I have had an overall good experience with Facebook. The only complaint that I have is that if you post in too many groups, you will be temporarily blocked from posting regardless of your content. Perhaps this is to stop spamming, but I think it could be more intuitive, less mechanical and automated. As a website though, it is the best for social networking. I use it almost every day.
Facebook	Elizabeth Jones	2018-03-15T20:48:59Z	2	Though, it has a lot of great uses as connecting with old friends and long-distance family, there are many others issues that Facebook.com upholds. The nature of some of their content is seemingly vulgar. Podcasting and live cams are way too graphic for the natural mind. It allows such content to be allowed without subject to discrimination. That includes murder and mass nudity. These are seen as crimes in some countries, but, for others, it is found susceptible. It needs more security for sure and strongly filtered content blockers.

Facebook	Alexis Nicole	2018-03-08T21:17:20Z	2	"Facebook has been around for about 14 years and people are still finding it interesting.  I wouldn't say it is my favorite website even though you can stay connected to the world. But Twitter does that a little better. Facebook is known for not being save, actually no social media is, but Facebook is the worse. I like it but I don't love it. You can get "" Message Request"" from people you don't even know and they can send you message, they could be inappropriate or threatening.  Blocking and reporting them doesn't do any good because all they have to do is create another account.  Facebook isn't as safe as it should be. There are 9 years using this website, not knowing what they are getting themselves into and still Facebook is opened to the world."
Facebook	Sheleen Hems	2018-03-06T20:32:01Z	1	"I believe Facebook has simply become too big an 'operation' to treat it's customers and clientele with any form of fairness - or with a human perspective at all!I recently set up a new account, using a name that although was not my birth name, was still a valid name that I used daily. Facebook waited until I had become involved in a numberof groups and pages, before shutting down my profile with no warning whatsoever. They requested I send them proof of who I was - but would not accept any explanation as to why I couldn't send the proof they requested (basically, a passport or drivers license photocopy).All I recieved was an automated response that was barely disguised as being from a real person, stating the information I had given them was not a valid passport or license copy.I eventually sent them a copy of my passport , just so they would read an e-mail I had sent to them, and to confirm that I was a real person and not some strange stalker-type weirdo who had set up a new profile to hurt someone. I also included links to my online store that clearly shows the name I use as being identical to that of the Facebook profile I had set up, as well as yet another eplanation as tothe name being used..The reply was almost inane compared to the question I had asked about reinstating my profile.""You need a page"" they stated -nothing else ... no explanation on how to get my profile reinstated, or reason as to why it was disabled in the first place. No true conversation has been achieved with Facebook - just automated replies that pretend to be from a real person. Since December 2017, they won't even reply to my e-mails at all. Apparently, I don't exist (much the same as their customer service).Facebook does not care about their users - they just want to make money.They ban pages and profiles for unjust reasons, and yet let paedophiles and criminals do 'business' through their site.They need to put the human face back into facebook, and start interacting realistically with their users.Sadly, I am still  facebook user, using a differnt proile- but only to keep in contact with some family. As soon as I can, I will delete all accounts and tell them in no uncertain terms to ""shove it where the sun don't shine!""If I could give zero or negative stars, I truly would.I'm seriously wondering if BT and facebook take customer relations advice from each other!"

Facebook	Taylor Sappe	2018-03-01T17:42:07Z	1	I had set up a business page on Facebook and had an increasing reach as I interacted with people who liked my page.  I needed to advertise and upcoming event, so I placed a Facebook ad and set a budget limit.  For the money, my add reached many more people than expected and I was happy with the results.  After a few days Facebook billed me for the ad and I manually paid for it using PayPal.  When the event had expired I cancelled the ad, but still got messages from Facebook telling me how my ad is continuing to perform.  I went into my ad manager and deleted the ad.  I continued to get messages telling me how many people my ad reached, and at the end of the month I was not only billed for the ad again, but they automatically took the payment from my paypal account.To top it off, when I checked my reach for my posts they were much less than they were before I had placed the ad.  This tells me that once they get you paying for an ad they reduce the reach of your posts so they can get you to continue to pay for ads.  That's just bad business ethics in my opinion, and Facebook doesn't leave any information on how to contact them to rectify this situation.

Facebook	Honest Reviews	2018-01-13T12:32:15Z	2	Facebook had the good intention of connecting friends and family seamlessly no matter how far away, however it has become a platform for abuse and extremists. You can't join a single group without having to hear someone's personal views and beliefs shoved down your throat, should you disagree with or have a different view you will receive abusive personal messages and comments left on the page. Obvious facts and scientific evidence is disregarded in favour or personal belief, and people create groups just to start a cult. I've had people claim, science means nothing, and it don't matter if someone is committing fraud as long as it makes people feel better. Avoiding the groups on things you love, interests, hobbies, bands, stars, etc is the way to go.  The only thing Facebook is good for is finding friends of family you have lost contact with, (or people you are stalking) but even then you will need to know there full married names and or locations. Being that you have lost contact with these people you probaly won't have this information, making it only good for stalking people you know details of. Which leads me to, if you have an abusive ex, ex friend, or just a stalker who wishes to know your personal life and or give you grief best you struggle with the hundreds of different settings to make your profile invisible to anyone not already on your friends list, again making anyone with good intent trying to find you impossible. Furthermore,  they changed the messaging service so you now have to install another app and risk all your personal information on another platform. No one ever gets banned or punished for there rude, extreme or aggressive abusive messages. You can block people so they cannot abuse you further but this does not stop there extremist views being pushed on and threats being made to others.They also try to force you to upload I.D of yourself personally so they can verify your name, this seems hugely inappropriate and they should just accept they created a platform for trolls and abuse and should shut down there website if they cannot control the problem not police the users like a corrupt government.The only real actual use of Facebook is communicating between friends and family, which you could use a phone for and as such bypass all of the other problems with this service.
Facebook	Lili Hallett	2018-01-12T22:42:05Z	3	I like Facebook it allows me I keep in contact with my family that live away and my friends however it’s also telling young people they need to develop a brand and a profile when there still figuring out what they want to be in life you have to make yourself seem ten times better than you actually are and it makes ping people a target for cyber bullying which can lead to horrible things so it’s a good website in some respects and not a good website in others

Facebook	Trajan Cassius	2018-01-11T01:41:24Z	1	Had used for years no problem..until 2 days ago..i dont know how but they found out that the name i used for the account (the name i give everyone online or in real life, i just havent gone through the legal hassle of officially changing it) is not what appears on say my birth certificate and they DEMANDED i send them copies of my ID!! After lots of arguing mostly with automated responses (when they could be bothered to do even that, 3 times they just locked my account or sent me what i can only interpret as a mocking insults of an email that said something basically like click this link and everything will work normally again, which then took me to a page that said actually we just disabled your account and blacklisted your email address), i gave up finally..i dont know what to make of all this and i dont intend to lose sleep over it..but my mind is drawn to previously unmemorable rumours that they have some agenda that concerns itself with my personal and private information..In the UK i dont even have to show the police my ID if i dont want to..(and unless ofc they actually just saw you commit some crime there is nothing they can do) so who the hell do facebook think they are to DEMAND that of me? I had no feelings good or bad about facebook before but now i actively despise and distrust it..thats all i can say..

Facebook	Luise Williams	2018-01-10T19:45:09Z	3	I like Facebook for interacting with friends but customer service is faceless ( pun intended)  I have bought a few things from ads on here that are of very shoddy quality, can't get refunds or just take your money but don't send the product, these scammers should be blocked from using Facebook to sell. Also using pictures of babies to get likes. Facebook must know the scammers and they should be blocked.
Facebook	Gelukkige Klant	2018-01-10T09:17:09Z	1	I created a new account because my boss forced me to link our company's website social media plugin to facebook (to publish news there automatically). While following the instructions of the plugin on how to link the plugin to a facebook app my (fresh) account got locked for suspicious activity. Ever since I am asked to upload a photo of mine to reactivate my account again but I recieve no reaction of facebook nor can I make contact anywhere... way to go you overrated fail company!The least i can do is leaving my well deserved comment and warn the world to evade this trash whenever you can and whenever your boss mentions facebook: look for another job!

Facebook	Chris Roberts	2018-01-09T00:50:05Z	1	One of the worst media companies on earth. They NEVER reply to any questions or user concerns.  They depend on a clueless Artificial Intelligence and third world moderators that lack proper training and are bullied by their supervisors.  They often mark posts as spam when they are not.  Their moderators never reply to questions. They run Facebook in such a way that many users if giving a competitor would leave.  It’s become a horribly run , user unfriendly mess.  Facebook has become a monopoly and a form of Public Communication that may need to be regulated in the very near future.
Facebook	David	2018-01-07T01:42:46Z	4	Great experience and a must have for any business these days. Huge market and easy way to interact and get to know clients better. Would of been 5 stars but it's hard to contact them and if they don't approve of certain paid adverts (normal adverts that don't offend anyone) they don't give much detail why.

Now I stop paying, I cannot post to more than 5 classifieds groups without getting suspended for 3 days. Disgusting, greed driven, monopoly that is probably illegal in many ways.

Facebook	Chris Austin	2017-12-30T01:37:18Z	2	I finally deleted my Facebook account about a year ago because I found that it was 'taking' more from me than I was getting back. I don't regret leaving Facebook and I would recommend others do the same. It is not good! So many ads. And the algorithms they use accidentally damage real-life relationships. Is it really worth it to you? All the content you upload to their website. They are making money from you! It wasn't like this 'back in the day'. It is a vicious place where people psychologically and subtly manipulate and attack others. You might use it in a very innocent way, But doesn't mean that somebody else isn't playing off your moves - to take what they WANT from society. There's too much to explain in one review. Every photo uploaded, comment, share - Are all movements by players in a big social game to steal prizes - Where real people are being hurt and traded around. The Facebook company isn't intrinsically bad, But what the website has become - Has made it very easy for bad people to achieve good things - Evil people command their Facebook armies to TAKE what THEY want from society!! If you've just got less than 100 real friends on there, say, and you share your photos with privacy settings, Use Facebook no more than once a week, say, then you've probably got nothing to worry about (But I would say that you would probably be better off using a different service). As soon as you become friends with the wrong person, They will DRAIN off you. You have been warned!

Facebook	Owl 333	2017-12-25T00:54:27Z	1	"Reporting system is sub-standard to say the least. In other words it's completely useless. Fake accounts spamming me with messages and they don't get removed because ""we found it doesn't violate our Community Standards."" nor do videos of animal abuse or child abuse, and comments about hate speech to direct death threats. Reporting several times makes no difference, the algorithm for reporting doesn't work, I assume there aren't any real people at Facebook viewing these reports because otherwise they definitely WOULD be removed. Zuckerberg then puts a message saying ""community matters"" on your feed all about how Facebook is there to help us etc etc etc! haha, god help anybody who actually needs content removing or is threatened! Useless! Other social media companies manage good reporting system, but facebook's is incompetent!"

Facebook	David Gullen	2017-12-20T17:35:06Z	1	I was a reluctant user of facebook anyway and simply wanted to have a facebook page for my small business. I just wanted a presence on the page not to constantly post to it...because of this inactivity they disabled the account until i sent them id - then they enabled me. So i began using it. Then they stopped me because of 'unusual activity' ie I was using it....so they sent me a code to prove it was me...but the code did not input...so here I am having wasted far too much time on a platform I didn't particularly want to be on in the first place. Bye facebook
Facebook	Ryan Jarvis	2017-12-20T14:29:26Z	3	"Facebook is a great tool to communicate with your friends, family and colleagues. I am just surprised to see that over the years the support seems to have got poorer not better!Their should be a facility for businesses who manage pages to be able to contact an actual person. I am concerned that Facebook can take so much money off individuals and businesses wishing to advertise but think they don't have a responsibility to provide adequate support. Raising reports that have disclaimers which say ""we don't reply to all requests but we do read them"" is just poor to say the least!I also think Facebook have a strong responsibility to ensure that individuals and businesses can use the social network without having to see posts which are inappropriate and contain things such as hate speech, terrorism, murder, sexual crimes, drug crimes and FAKE NEWS!!!!"

React and Rosefiled even emailed them advising they only wanted post deleted not my accounts and will not reinstate Two subsequent accounts deleted after 5 hours therefore must be banned for life after ONE mistake when they need to consider the wider abuse by others Totally pulling hair out trying to contact them feel isolated and as though they are getting personal - Keeping people in touch !!!! to big to care about the little people who helped make them who they are
Facebook	Kirsty	2017-12-07T22:15:06Z	3	I’ve always liked Facebook as I felt it was the safest social network, but now I’m not so sure. I feel it has potential spyware as whenever I’ve visited a website, adverts pop up in Facebook relating to that site & it happens almost every time, so it’s not a coincidence. I use a browser for web searches & the Facebook app, so it’s not browser linked. I’m on a private profile & I don’t share personal info on my account publicly, but it’s concering me a little, to the point I’m not using it much now.

Facebook	Sean	2017-12-01T18:09:48Z	2	Great social networking experience, it's a global social network and to 'not' have a Facebook account in 2017 is almost a sin.That being said, the incredibly heavy false sense of security that Facebook tries to force upon us with their constant 'security checks'  and updates. Yes facebook is decently secure, but do not think for one second that this company values privacy as much as they say they do.The 'limit my past posts' function is simply useless. It does absolutely nothing yet confirms that it worked. I found an old facebook account using MY face as the profile picture, I have sent over a dozen requests to facebook two months ago and I have yet to hear back them from, this is dissapointing and may eventually lead to legal action on my end seeing as they simply refuse to communicate directly with their loyal long-time users.
Facebook	magdafloasiu	2017-11-30T11:14:42Z	1	"Today morning, when I tried to log in to my Facebook account, I received this message: ""Hi X, we're continuously working to keep your account secure. We've noticed that this device may be infected with malicious software. To continue to use Facebook, you can either use other devices or clean this device by downloading the scanner provided by Facebook and ESET.""I checked Facebook forums and it seems that many people have had the same issue. However, Facebook staff don't bother to reply or say anything on whether the software they force us to download in order to get access to our accounts is legit or not. Many people complain that the software recommended by Facebook screwed up their computers. The fact that there is no official answer from Facebook makes you wonder. Lately, Facebook has started to look more and more like a malicious platform...Very disappointing.."

I deleted my account back in 2010, but later discovered than none of my details, nor photos had been deleted at all. A friend has even had a ridiculous request from the staff to send in a copy of their passport, and the support services are highly incompetent.

I do not swear and and am mindful of social protocol. Without giving me a reason Facebook banished me into cyber suspension for 2 weeks. I appealed. No answer. Why bother having an Appeal system if nobody answers you? Yet they kept sending me reminders to spend money with them. When will Facebook start treating its users as people and not data mining revenue Streams. Without us there would be no Facebook.

Facebook	Bryan	2017-10-25T15:05:45Z	2	It's the service that more or less defined social media. They even made a film about it. But while it has brought many of us together with those we had lost or might never have met, it has regrettably not evolved in terms of user wants, most notably in the customer service area. Facebook provides one of the worst customer service experiences of any major company on Earth. There is quite literally no way to reach anyone live any longer. And certainly no way to reach any of the decision makers in their executive offices. The attitude has pretty much always been if you don't like what they're offering you for free you're free to go elsewhere. The typical arrogance of any company that has an effective monopoly.Facebook continually makes so-called improvements that seem more designed for the enjoyment of the hackers who run the place than for its users. What most Facebook users really want is for some multi-billionaire like Richard Branson to come along and start a company that can pose a real challenge to Facebook by listening to users while offering a similar experience. The only company to come along at all has been one that few have even heard of, Ello. Well worth trying.

Facebook	louise	2017-10-15T08:43:38Z	1	I think Facebook is a horrible place. I think there is a lot of nasty people on there. If you stand up for yourself you get blocked. It's full of adults acting like children. If they don't like your comments then they troll you. I only use it to get hold of my cousin and that's it. I find it is full of pathetic adults with no lives who go around acting like trolls and picking on people if they don't like what they have posted. Very immature place. Think the world would be better without Facebook to be honest. Just be prepared to get abuse from people if they have a different opinion. It's like being back at school. You see lots of sick videos on there killing animals, child abuse and more yet you can't stand up for yourself against a adult throwing a tantrum over your comment. That will get you blocked but they will leave animal abuse videos on there. Very sick place. I swear Facebook is the cause of a lot of relationships breaking up and it is making it easier for people to bully. I think Facebook should be ashamed of themselves for the content on the website.

Facebook	Tessa Toohey	2017-09-30T00:52:03Z	4	Facebook is a great way to communicate with the people you know and meet. It's a space for opinions and pictures! Your settings could be private or public, or just for friends. Facebook can greatly improve your friendships by connecting you in ways that otherwise would not exist-i.e. Picture albums, live videos, feeds, posts and comments. They even offer GIF /emojis to capture human emotion better. It's pretty freaking cool!

Facebook	Jennie	2017-09-19T15:44:55Z	3	I am not happy with Facebook.1, On my timeline, I get to see only about a dozen of my friends' posts and few pages' posts. But I have more than 1500 posts. I want to get to interact with all of them, instead of coming online one three hours later to see the same crop of posts. Auughhh. 2, They don't show your posts to a lot of people. I get very few reaction for my effort and they are brilliant efforts. I try to be funny, inspiring, insightful etc, but Facebook only shows my post to very few people which can be frustrating.3, They are even worse with pages. They want you to sponsor your post to reach a lot of people. So they show your posts to between 2 to 3 percent of your entire likers! That is indecent.4, They allow a lot of nonsense. And they put it on my lifeline. Most of this nonsense is fake news and soft porn from groups that I am not even a member of. I try to report this posts but there is no button to do that. I have to block these people one after the other. And for each one you block, two take their place. Sigh.5, They put you in groups you didn't accept to join. Once someone adds you to a group you automatically become a member! This is wicked.Unfortunately, I can go on and on, listing some of the worse ways Facebook has frustrated me and hurt their image.

Facebook	Tamsyn	2017-09-06T11:21:02Z	3	The personal side of Facebook is great and I have nothing negative to say... the business side however. Business manager is dreadful, what Facebook has done to the algorithms etc for business pages sucks and it's all left a very sour taste in my mouth. My small business has suffered hugely after gaining a tonne of exposure initially starting on Facebook to now barely having any because of the changes Facebook made over the years :(. The customer service of Facebook is also extremely unsatisfactory, if they actually get back to you at all.

Facebook	Tomáš Erben	2017-09-05T20:13:50Z	4	Facebook enabled me to connect with my existing friends but it also allowed me to find new people with similar interests. Also it gives the oppurtunity to make some good money with facebook groups as well as facebook ads. I hope they will accelerate the speed and the quality of the newsfeed nowadays, it gets really slow. Otherwise it is very helpful.
Facebook	Franky	2017-09-05T08:08:46Z	1	For several months we advertised on FB.  Then for no apparent reason, they blocked our ads.  I wrote to them it took several months to get a response, and apparently, my ads didn't meet their regulations.  As anyone who has posted ads on FB knows when you create an advertisement an algorithm tests it to make sure it conforms to the companies rules.  After we created our ad it came back ok.  It seems odd to me that their own algorithm told them it was ok but some one in their organisation decided it didn't.  It's not enough that they steal and sell your information now when you want to play along they lock you out;You would have to be a fool to trust this website.

I would rather not have to write this but it's true, so...You can see animals being killed and tortured, dead people or people being attacked, racist/sexist/abusive/extremist content and if you report it they just say ""it doesn't breach community guidelines."". Anybody uploads someone breastfeeding and it gets taken down immediately but can see an abandoned baby in a ditch (Reported but ""didn't breach guidelines"", reported again and same result). The reporting system has such limited options and basically gives me the impression they don't care!"

Facebook	Harald Madsen	2017-07-25T16:00:55Z	1	Today I bought a pair of Rayban Sunglasses at Solid Gold Jewellers in Bugibba.The price was 173€ but I got a discount and paid 155€.I walked to my hotel about half a mile from the shop, changed in my room and went to the pool. When I laid down on sunbed I took of my new sunglasses and one if the nose supports stuck to my nose.Bad luck I thought and walked back to the shop after about 2 hours by the pool – so I was back about 4 hours after I bought the sunglasses. I was asked to go to another shop, the main shop further up the street.When I got there the two girls in the shop first tried to but the nose support back on but was unable and offered to repair the sunglasses, but then I would have to wait a day or so.I asked for a replacement or a refund. They did not have the same model and they offered me to pick another pair of sunglasses, which I went on to do.While I was looking at other sunglasses they found a scratch, they were unable to show me this scratch but both the girls said there was a scratch. Now back in my hotel I am still unable to find the scratch.They now refused to take the sunglasses back and again offered to repair them. Since I am unable to wait for the repair that was not an option.So, I am left with a pair of unusable, but quite expensive sunglasses for the rest of my vacation. I bought, what I thought was a quality pair of sunglasses to avoid them breaking and I bought them at what appeared to be a real store and not just a tourist trap – clearly, I was wrong.I did get very upset by the treatment and I would wish there was grounds for legal actions including reporting the shop to the police. However, it seems quite obvious that this is not a matter for neither the police or the judicial system (no matter how upset I am) – it is simply a case of bad business ethics.Consequently, all I can do is to warn and discourage anyone from trading at either of the solid gold stores in Bugibba.
Facebook	Frances Uju Umehz	2017-07-23T00:42:09Z	5	"Facebook is a popular social-networking site created in 2004 by 19 year old Mark Zukerberg.  Facebook has helped users like me connect with family members, old classmates of many years ago, friends and people of my choosing based on shared interest. Also, it allows me to share my best pictures and see what friends think of it on the comment and like section. Facebook has a section for users to say what's on their mind and express their mood at any point in time and also, text and post videos. It is a really great way to engage your leisure and also grow your business!  I am able to play games, watch videos, customise my page, share favorite product information, ""like"" favorite celebrities and social causes, live-stream video, connect with goods and services, and live-chat via Messenger.                               Facebook's versatility and so much functionality has saved lots of people via it's marketing platform where companies can reach a wider audience of about 1.6billion registered users from all over the world! statistics provided by Facebook for instance  reveals that as of March 2014 there were 1.28 billion active users on the site per month, and at least 802 million of these users logged into Facebook every day. With statistics such as these, it is not surprising that Facebook is the most popular Social Networking Site in the world.                                                                      In conclusion,  Facebook has saved as a diary for me, I get to write events and post pictures and can view my progressions over the years anytime I feel like, also, with facebook, my business has been able to spread to a wider audience and I keep in touch with friends and family. Facebook is simply awesome!"

Facebook	Tammy C. Mowbray	2017-07-17T07:55:32Z	5	As one of the biggest and most enduring social networks, it has many elements that are attractive to users, but it's important to know the ins and outs before your teen starts posting. Though lots of teens are now only using Facebook as one of many methods of communicating, it's still relevant, continues to innovate, and keeps adding more features. In fact, it's hard to keep up with its acquisitions and new capabilities, so it's a good idea to check settings periodically and have an account of your own to stay on top of things.
Facebook	pete	2017-07-12T18:32:07Z	1	Pulling people away from human contact,it does nothing but make people depressed and aid in bullying,i know it wasn't created for that reason but that's exactly what it does 👎
Facebook	Charlotte	2017-07-12T15:42:46Z	2	FB ads have more indexes that just about any advertising platform (gender, age, location etc) however after 2 years of advertising with FB on a PPC basis, we lost 20% of our followers in a week. FB told us they were just removing fake profiles but if we acquired them via FB's very own Pay Per Click advertising, it raises some serious questions as to who and where the fake accounts were coming from, and who was benefiting by having them click our ads?? On top of this a Pages generated content cannot reach genuine followers unless the reach is paid for. Because of these reasons we cannot continue spending our money on FB ads.

Facebook	Paul Aeschbacher	2017-07-04T20:00:56Z	1	I'm a non-profit that uses a Facebook page.  Out the blue Facebook is claiming I have an unpaid balance of .97 cents and wants billing information.  I looked for a customer service communication avenue to inquire about the so called unpaid balance but to no avail.  I sent two inquiries to a general help area and again to no avail.  I refused to update billing information until my dispute of the .97 cents is answered.  I strongly believe Facebook has an obligation to provide me with an accounting for the amount they are trying to collect.  Too bad, I wanted to start sponsoring posts again but not until I get an answer.  My page may be hacked for all I know.  Bottomline, Facebook has made it impossible to contact them!
Facebook	ExpertReviewer	2017-07-04T15:40:39Z	1	I absolutely hate Facebook. I only use it because some of my friends are too stubborn to install WhatsApp or use texting anymore. I don't know why people are so obsessed with Facebook when you can text, call or WhatsApp. I am not easily shocked or offended, but if I see something that is blatantly wrong, I will report it. Facebook and their 'community standards' are ridiculous.I reported a video of a disabled old man walking from the shops and being ridiculed and abused by a group of chavs who thought they were the best thing since sliced bread. I reported the video on the grounds of it being disability discrimination. Apparently it didn't breach the community standards and wasn't taken down. I had the exact same response when I reported a video showing a dog being shot dead using the reporting option for animal cruelty. I've reported images like 100% naked women with men between their legs on the basis that it's pornography and not suitable for minors etc. Apparently porn doesn't breach the 'community standards' either.There is so much bullying and trolling conducted on Facebook through pages and comments on posts and it doesn't seem to be policed at all.Facebook is a vile cesspit with no standards, no policing and no repercussions for law breakers. They change so many things so regularly that it's impossible to know 100% who can see what and how private your details really are. I'd love to delete my account, but there's at least 4 people I know who can't be contacted any other way. Adverts are constantly spamming your news feed, some of which don't even correlate to your actual interests in any way whatsoever.Facebook is a cancer in society.

Then the fact that Facebook is such a huge social media site and yet it still allows sickening violent videos to be posted of babies getting abused or people getting stabbed, Just unacceptable. Facebook should just close its doors and call it a day. The worst part about Facebook is it don't even have a dislike button. I'm not being funny but I dislike at least 75% of the awful posts on there, yet I have no way to easily show the dislike I have to go into detail writing but who want to do that with today's emoji hype? Not suitable for anyone with a brain.

Facebook	Ryan Raynott	2017-05-10T14:11:31Z	2	"Facebook is a great social network to communicate and keep people up to date with personal or business updates, however their support is literally non existent and they feel they are not accountable for the posts which are shared on their website. Facebook needs to be regulated especially when relating to political campaigns and posts/videos relating to violence, pornography, inappropriate groups and terrorism . They are a multi-billion pound company and seem to think they are untouchable when it comes to ""learning lessons"". I am glad the UK Government have instigated an investigation into Facebook and am in the hope that protections will be put in place to keep people safe, and hold Facebook more accountable for their actions!"

I am so annoyed with all this, all I want is to exchange a blouse, which was sent and is to small. I am also waiting for 2 other blouses to come, which are is transit now. If they do not fit I want a refund for those to. I cannot believe how this business operates! They should have a toll free number for customers to call especially with sizing issues! Very poor business reviews that I have been reading on the company!  A big disapointment in how they leave there customers hanging! Then before you know it the return time of 30 days is up!

Tried to delete it, even though I managed to obtain the log in details (an old email address used by them, which no longer exists), inc I guessed the password.  Now they want proof of who I am, impossible to match as the details given were not mine, so do not match my date of birth etc Surely, they could at least have a proper email address.  I know it is a free website, however adverts pay for it, it is a wealthy business, so pay for support It would put me off advertising with them, that's for sure I'm am sure they do not care about bad reviews on here, but thought I'd mention the issue, just in case!

I also don't like the fact that they have vendors selling fake clothes or goods (mostly from countries such as China)...I complained about some adverts a while back which claimed I had won a competition...I clicked through and was asked to pay money to release the money. These links are appalling. Facebook need to tow the line as far as ethics go. Hopefully they're listening now?

Facebook	Allan	2017-04-01T02:41:41Z	1	"I have 4 comments about Facebook. One of these, is complimentary. Ie1. It is a great social media site in which friends can easily get together. This is contrasted by - 2. It is supposed to be a censored site. I am no prude but some of the language used I can't accept. I remember some time ago, I requested Facebook intervene. My request message was ignored. With that, I promptly closed my Facebook account (I thought).3. Some time later, I discovered that, even though I thought the account was closed and I'm not using it, it was still active. Because of this, I considered I may as well use it again.4. Lately, I have been getting many messages from Facebook, saying, ""Your account has been logged into from near ..........."". Very interesting,  because I have not been to these places, some of which are 400 kilometres (250 miles) away. These are obviously illegal logins or a major discrepancy. Either way, Facebook don't want to know about it or offer any advice. So, how do I fix the problem? No-one knows. I could find no phone number or e-mail address, to contact. I even wrote ('snail-mail') to Facebook. I expected them to realize I was serious in trying to find a 'fix' to the apparent problem. This was approximately a month ago and I'm still waiting for a reply (or even, an acknowledgement).It appears that Facebook have no intention of enforcing their own rules. Also, there appears to be no way of getting accurate advice from them.Yes, Facebook is interesting and socially, great. No, I still can't recommend it."

The money guy calls himself Richard ((D)ick) Williams (Bill) translated to someone asking for a pile of bills without delivering and dicking you over. They will do call you 24 hours a day to get you to pay and Your payment will rarely even go through on any major pay site like paypal because they have done this scam before. Very unprofessional and should be kicked off the internet's business for lack of competency and product.

Facebook	Simon Everett	2017-01-22T20:26:25Z	1	After using facebook for the purpose of helping promote business, I am always faced with being banned for 2weeks with no reason or explanation, I am part of many groups and post several dozen posts all following the guidelines of each group and posting probably about twice a week with occasions of longer gaps, So at irregular intervals Facebook keep banning for 2weeks and each time they offer an appeal they never ever!! respond or have the curtsey to at least explain why it happens or indeed if im doing something wrong which i don't feel i am, I feel this is such poor and rubbish social media, that more people should be made aware especially as facebook dominants most social media and with that fact they just don't care, So facebook if your reading this change your your support policy and bother to answer your general public clients, as on the face of it, by not even answering any support questions, they your just a waste of space as far as i can see, perhaps people will be a lot happier with your social media franchise it you bothered to talk and explain to us.Conclusion Lack of any ability to help the general public with any questions and with no direct support structure it is impossible to contact you, with regards any problems and issues we have.

Passed from pillar to post, promised that I would be put in touch with someone so I could submit a request for compensation for the time I was unable to access my account, but the only suggestion they had (despite numerous chases from me) was to submit ""feedback"" via their generic form which may/may not be dealt with. After specifically asking to be put in touch with someone who could help, I was subsequently ignored completely. We spend £100's per month on Facebook ads and it's not the service I expect. We are a charity, so this is a total waste of donors money which could be going towards recruiting the volunteers we so desperately need to carry out our work. Unforgiveable."

Facebook	T Mahoney	2016-11-23T10:35:56Z	1	My wife has started accusing me of seeing a former work colleague behind her back. Apparently Facebook has come up saying I have been to various venues with this lady in 2015 and 2016. I have had no notification of this and have not seen the lady concerned for about 5 years when she changed jobs. The only exceptions to this were when I was picking my wife up from where she had been doing some voluntary work and the lady walked in. The other was when I was working as a guide on the Bristol Insight Open Top bus and I was seen by her and she rushed up the stairs gave me a quick kiss, in front of the customers, and rushed off. She had her small grand daughter with her.My wife has accused me of seeing her on a number of occasions and this has caused a rift in our marriage.Facebook has said that I went to St Mart Redcliffe Church with the lady. I have walked past the church and also parked outside of it when going into work. I haven't entered the church for at least 10 years.I am considering taking legal action against Facebook and have permanently deleted my account.

Facebook	Nyantakyi Osei-Adu	2016-11-09T15:10:38Z	4	Facebook is a great app, but the notifications can be too many at times. For example, different friends can comment on a post I'm tagged with, and there is no problem receiving notifications on each comment, but since those notifications are linked to the same post, I'll suggest that as soon as I follow a notification to a post, all other notifications attached to the same post should be automatically marked as read.This would prevent the occurrence of following notifications to comments you may have seen already.

Tawfik	2016-09-15T14:18:43Z	4	"Hello Facebook, I just have to tell you that my experience with your platform started on March 2010 since that day i can tell that Facebook changed my life. I dedicated a lot of hours on Facebook as it was part of my High School, University, 1st Job and its still playing the same outstanding role in my life.As you guys continue gathering people with different culture and backgrounds into one place to share ideas and discuss thoughts that can actually create a difference in people life`s.But so far for the last 3 years i didn`t found a lot of changes in the platform it self as you guys still do a lot of upgrades and add new features and always we are ""MENA region"" the last who gets provided by these upgrades. This is not fair treatment also not what i expected from a platform that i trust my personal data and my life updates on. So if you guys don`t want us to abandon your platform ""Its already happening"" you better do some serious changes in the platform services. We need to feel that this platform is creative again."

Facebook	hanan aw	2016-09-07T07:07:08Z	1	Some people who have not manner still free do some action in facebook. Some violence word can't be reviewed because slang language or acronyms. some hoax and haters propaganda can't be reported. If that still continues, can bring effects as chaos even wars. also don't  block account permanently, because you don't know what's our bussiness that can give us food for eat and valuable friendship who related us on facebook.

Facebook	irma	2016-08-14T11:39:32Z	2	"Nowadays, Facebook became very unsecure social media for me. People can duplicate your profile picture without any approval, and it's not against facebook's community standard . In Facebook, there is no regulation about ""if you use gender as male, you should put name as a boy or a man not as a woman"".People also can share any pornograph picture or video, Facebook will removed it if someone report it, it's too late for it-you know. Facebook should prevent before its share, not after its share.I really dissapointed for this, and I hope facebook reviewed my review as an advice for facebook's better tomorrow.Thanks"

But still far from perfect, it's proved by the many bot comments, fake accounts, phissing links, etc. But I believe Mark with his team can handle it. Due to the above reasons, i just can gives three stars. Not because i don't like it. But, i wanna see Facebook more perfect in the future.Thanks

Hope everyone knows the true heart of Facebook experience and use it for the best benefit of the mankind .

So I can sell things using Facebook to buy another internet package and surf the internet, again.That's all tho :/

Facebook	Wiandry Adi Wasistio	2016-07-31T04:54:55Z	3	Every features in Facebook are perfect (esp. Notes, when you know most of your friends hate long, complex paragraph that describes/explains nerdy or conspiracy stuff), in my opinion. However, one think is missing, and it's kinda critically essential: just let me see who's seen my posts, just like what 'that other social networking app' do (sorry for comparing, but frankly, this feature is what I seek for eternity!). It's like:You see your posts, and the posts let you know who's seen your posts, because rhetorically, Facebook users just look at the posts, and scroll down. That's it, no trace: no likes, comments, etc. So, it keeps me wondering, is my post unnoticed?In conclusion, just let the users see who has seen their posts (like: seen by X friends). And, I'm really sorry for comparing this with 'that other social networking app', but seriously, this may really helpful for anyone who's living their life with 'like-less/comment-less' posts, including me.It's OK if our posts aren't liked/commented. Just seeing them are priceless

Facebook	Asmaa Usama	2016-07-30T14:51:02Z	3	I think Facebook should undergo some changes, especially concerning notification settings, for exapmle, the option when I type a comment for a friend and then I start to get notifications each time when another person type a comment for the same post, and I have to turn off notifications for each post I type comments on and this is really annoying !! Also, I suggest  FB administration develop an easier method for the users to reach older posts considered as memories or so,, either on my own page or a group..etc,. For example, searching for the post by date or a keyword,, and thank you so much for caring about our opinions.

But I and some others just think fb don't give enough care to Arabic reports we made about some pages which insult girls or religion in our community... You each time just send the same answer that those pages or those bad names aren't against your law or rules..  Think it would be better if you get an Arabic native speaker to translate the reports colloquial content.. Thanks anyway for surveying opinions. :)

Facebook	L.Bunch	2016-07-21T09:59:35Z	1	If you want to have your own business promoted on FB just forget about it. Not only that the only way you can do this successfully is by paying tuns of money but also it causes more harm than good. Think twice before creating  a business page because it doesn't cost the efforts, money and most important your time. Especially if you are constantly bombarded with fake reviews and you can't do anything about it.

As I'm sure you know, they get paid per-click. But they use the most clickbait-y options and the products and services they try to get you to hook up with are quite trash. Just beware what you're clicking on, especially for the older generation.

FACEBOOK CARES NOTHING OF MILLIONS OF MEMBERS BEING RIPPED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AS LONG AS THEY GET PAID FOR THE ADS.

Facebook	Stuart Wright	2016-05-05T20:32:43Z	4	I started using facebook back in its inception and was using Myspace and Bebo before it for all my social contact on the web, I found it much easier to post snippets of this and that, then writing long winded emails to people. I have found it very useful for networking the releases of my new musical albums and posting what I'm doing on YouTube on my music channel! There is a downside and that you can post wrong or bad information but self regulation is needed and I don't use facebook every day like some people do. I guess you can play games and catch up with all your latest hobbies and fan bases I like Facebook and using it in moderation is key, like anything in life and don't understand how one could get addicted to such a thing!

Great to keep in touch with friends and family all around the world, and it is definitely something for my space time in the public transport! However, I have reported some page that was using my company logo and was kind of a fraud but they wouldn't delete it! another scam recently is that the facebook page of one of my friend has been duplicated with her picture name... and the person that talk to you is trying to get money out of you as you think there are your friend! I do think Facebook should have a better control of this and it should be more difficult to create a profile to prevent this or at least better data security.
Facebook	ron decline	2016-04-15T05:41:12Z	1	do not use facebook people.this is how the government and the fbi keep tabs on you.thats why you see all these companies telling you to tell us what you think using twitter or facebook.avoid these 2 companies at all costs.you dont need facebook anyways unless you have no life and are desperate for friends and attention.only people who have any excuse using facebook are people who need exposure like amatuer bands or celebrities who need attention cause it's their job.

Facebook	Hiroshi Mishima	2016-02-11T09:34:39Z	3	"The core idea of Facebook is being able to get all the people you know into one place where you can keep tabs on, talk to, and otherwise share experiences with no matter where you are in the world. Imagine a forum where everyone in the world has access at the touch of a button.Now imagine tons of spam, unwanted suggestions, creepy strangers, invasive security and Big Brother also here in this one place because that's exactly what Facebook is today. Not only does it often feel like absolutely anyone can look at and like your child's posts (shared with friends from school), but sometimes even personal information gets shown publicly during one of the various moments when Facebook breaks something.I LOVE that Facebook allowed me to get in contact with people I used to go to school with, and family that I hadn't heard from in forever. What chaffs is all the garbage Farmville posts, friend suggestions with total strangers, and the constant pressure to share every single song, actor or pizza topping I've ever liked. And you can't tell it ""No"", because Facebook doesn't listen to ""No"". It hears, ""ask me later"", which it will do the next time you come by. You can hide posts, you can block people, but you can't ever get rid of Facebook's persistence without.. you know.. actually leaving.Their mobile app sounded nice at first, too, but they kept updating and changing and making unnecessary tweaks or needing access to who knows what on your phone, so I dropped that over a cliff.However, as I said, at its core Facebook is both useful and a really great idea. There's a lot of people who use the service so the odds of someone you know being there are quite high, making it easy to look up old friends or displaced relatives."

Facebook	Paul Wood	2015-10-29T17:33:22Z	1	"Facebook have different rules for different people (complete double standards). If you report a photo of someone smoking  dope on their timelines (like I did) the site gives no credit to it but if you place a review on a business that they protect then the review is removed and you are advised that further ""violations' to their standards will result in having your account suspended. This is called censorship.Another pristine example of this repetitive behaviour was when I reported the abusive behaviour of a hotel manager that kept sending extremely offensive and defamatory messages via Facebook. Once again, it got reported to Facebook and they ignored it. The case was judged in court and the hotel manager was ordered to pay compensation for the damages caused to myself.Standards should be applied to everyone. Customer service and social/civil responsibilities seem to be optional for Facebook."

I use the web interface - works reasonably well but some bugs: too many notifications and it'll chug, marking notifications as read sometimes doesn't work, hard to see a simple timeline of important activity on the page etc...On the other hand, we've just started exploring the advertising potential of Facebook, and it is simply amazing. How precisely one can define a target audience, it's stunning if a little creepy. All in all, great but 3 stars because we expect the best from such a successful company.

Facebook	Barrie	2015-07-14T12:36:15Z	2	they need to police the site much better. I have seen some shocking videos that have been placed on the site and believe that this should not be allowed. It seems like its a free for all
Facebook	PaulCo	2015-07-11T13:26:51Z	1	They have to be the worst company in the world. So they have billions of people using the site but they are voiceless when it comes to complaining. The facility Facebook offer for reporting an issue is nothing short of a joke. The amount of stuff on the site that breaches their own Community Standards is an absolute disgrace.Nobody I know that has used the reporting facility has ever had a complaint upheld. Instead you get the same generic system message that says they don't feel it has breached the Community Standards, despite the fact that it obviously has. Individuals attempting to harass others and attract violence against them by placing their private home address and a description of their property online. Is that not a breach of the Community StandardsNo email contact, no telephone contact, in fact they just do not want to hear from people, there isn't even a contact number for police to use and the recorded message states this. Do they care? Of course they don't, they couldn't give a damn about what goes up on the Facebook site no matter how many children are bullied to death or innocent people targeted.Will they reply to this, will they want to be pointed to any of the stuff listed? Of course they won't, because the vast majority of sheople live their life on the site.Shame on you Facebook, you're a disgrace!
Facebook	Beccy Neville	2015-07-07T11:17:35Z	5	Although it is always updated (often unnecessarily), Facebook is great for keeping in touch with my friends, family and acquaintances. It is easy to use and allows people to share their images and stories with others.

Facebook	Zzeeb	2015-06-18T13:16:01Z	1	"I opened my Facebook business account months ago and since then I am not able to set up my ""Preferred Page Audience"" under settings.  Every time I try I get the following error message: ""Sorry, something went wrong while saving audience. Please try again later."" My posts do not reach more than a handful of people and I am getting no responses through Facebook.  In addition, I've spent quite a bit experimenting with advertisement and regardless of the thousands of people who are supposedly reached through my ads, I get no response!  I am really unhappy with Facebook.  It's been a complete waste of time and now I am looking for alternatives.  I think FB only works for large businesses who can spend hundreds of dollars on ads per week.  I've sent my complaint to FB 3 times already and even got to find other people complaining of the same problems, but we get no response from FB.  Basically, FB does not deliver what it promises.  I feel the whole thing is a complete lie."

Facebook	Football Reviews For You	2015-03-23T08:00:39Z	3	Facebook is great for catching up with your friends and even family also you can see all the latest news headlines and sports headlines updates, facebook can also be extremely dangerous for example getting hacked can cause problems to your life if the hacker goes to far also certain pages/people on facebook can easily give your computer viruses, i wouldn't say facebook is really bad but keep your profile to private and watch what pages/games ands people you interact with.
Facebook	EAL_Craig	2015-03-12T10:59:42Z	4	Good fun for the family and friends keeping up to date with each other but it is also easy for snooping busybodies to gain vital person pics/information on you so be careful with what you post :)

Facebook	George Morina	2015-01-06T01:31:45Z	4	I started using Facebook since 2005 but full time since 2007,I am more than happy with Facebook, it is the must powerful channel to deliver the messages to the public with fully focus on generic strategy. I have manage to receive  1.9 billion Impressions in the whole network  by  468 million social media  Users  with in 3 years 2011-2014  proven from trusted Social Media analytic's.Facebook it is great for Generic Brands, but not very easy for commercial brands who use commercial contents, as we know the costumer service it is very far from the standard based on the number of users and the number of people Facebook has employ. (Employees 8,348 September 2014) 864 million daily active users on average for September 2014! It means for every 100.000 users it is only one costumer service, and this it creates massive gab to communicate direct with Facebook costumer service. Other problem for online businesses who use Facebook to promote brands is that many brands  use wrong strategy where they focus on building large number of fans, instead of building interactions and communicating with the  fans and sharing idea how to improve the services, we must understand ,branding it is much cheaper than marketing.Some of the Users who use Facebook to chat and link with friends and families, they think Facebook is dating site  that is massive mistake.We must remember Facebook it works same as we chat and talk with people on real life, and is no need to think Oh I am on Facebook and I can talk and do whatever I like as no one can see me , and no one know about me.(if you try to use fake name) what is the point? who going to take you serious,? No one like to talk and chat with stranger, this is not the right thing to do on Facebook. I have managed to chat with  my network, and I have treat those people same as I was going to treat them if I was in the same room or face to face  with those people. This is the meaning of Social Networks and Facebook!George MorinaLondon United Kingdom.

Also facebook can now suggest friends based on who you have called on your phone!Really this is major privacy invasion!BOYCOT technology ! BOYCOT it all!  its going to take over!

You sign back in and it's back online.  It's always there.There are just too many people snooping, scamming, wanting money, invites, pokes and idiots on Facebook and it's really not needed.

Facebook	Rari	2014-08-28T20:59:02Z	1	After using facebook since 2009, I have seen a massive decline in both content and usage in the past year or two.At first you may think 'Great! A popular way to keep up with friends' Well, that would be the case if the website wasn't filled with disturbing content and links to malicious websites. Are the posts not controlled on here?I have seen numerous links, images and videos on this website that can be quite triggering or just generally disturbing. That is not the only thing that can be found here. Sexism, Racism, Bullying and more are quite frequent on facebook. After numerous reports and still nothing being done to remove or monitor content, That's when alarm bells start ringing.The only reason I continue to use Facebook on the odd occasion is too keep up with friends and family who I have no other way too communicate, It would be nicer if the posts were more monitored though.For me, Facebook is more trouble then its worth, If you don't want the drama or are easily disturbed or can be quite vulnerable, I would recommend staying away from here.

Facebook	john smith	2014-08-11T17:30:15Z	2	i've used facebook for 3 years now and i never saw the big picture. Facebook has stayed the same for a while now with just a more difficult to navigate and slow site including more games available and small extra features does not make a site better if no uses these features, everyone will see this soon.But even though there is nothing new it is almost as good as it was a few years ago, (not that good) easy ways to communicate have been taken over by skype and other communication apps that are free and easier to use and with increasing competition overall i would say 2/5 and will not last another 5 years without new large features and i don't think virtual reality technology will save it.

Facebook	marc	2014-05-23T09:30:24Z	2	Ok so Facebook doesn't really have any real competitors at the moment , I still use it to share funny stuff or occasional interesting stuff with my friends, I have some grave concerns over the visibility of personal stuff (photos/dates etc..)   so i now don't store any personal photos on Facebook  and regularly wipe my activity from face book, I also don't appreciate being made to install messenger app separately, So I'll be using the web version for the foreseeable future.You really have to to be aware that bad Facebook posts can affect your life ...even your chances of getting a job.... Almost every employer now checks to see what you share to evaluate your life/work ethics.Lately Facebook has turned into a Giant advertising billboard, so much so I spends more time hiding stuff from companies advertising there products than reading about my Family and friends ... I think its taken a massive step backwards

Facebook	Julie	2013-12-16T12:16:02Z	3	"I don't understand why they had to add new functions like ""Message was seen"", chat showing whether you're online on mobile or web browser. Surey facebook is the most staker friendly site I've ever encountered. But when the whole ""online/offline"" thing is bugged, it can piss some people off badly. Sometimes people show online despite logging off hours ago, I've been told I was online when I was sent a message, even though I wasn't. Should've left it at being able to deactive chat / have it activated, no more. I have days where I don't want to talk, if I accidently click a message that was unopened, that other person is either gonna be sad or pester me.I like the facebook minigames, and I like the overall design. I'd really wish that the people who don't like to play games could disable ALL game invites. It's not easy to pick 20 people out by names on your friendlist, whenever you send those mass-game requests which the mini-games offer. Not all games enable you to send requests to people who aready play the game, only. :("

Facebook	Kim Rashid	2013-03-04T09:01:46Z	2	I have Facebook's Privacy factors.
Facebook	Linda Fease	2013-01-31T06:45:07Z	5	"Come on people, how could a person legitimately leave a negative review for Facebook.com?  EVERYONE uses it.  If you don't like using it, then you don't have to... but I don't see this becoming a problem for anyone.  Sure, there are legitimate complaints about changes such as the dreaded ""Timeline"", but after a few weeks, these changes are just a part of everyday life.  In actuality, the changes haven't been horrible.  They do take a little getting used to, but in the long run, they end up creating a much user friendly environment in the social media market.  I simply don't see Facebook going the way of MySpace anytime soon."
Facebook	Carrie Speiser	2013-01-21T03:22:19Z	4	But the downside is privacy.
Facebook	Seri1212	2013-01-06T17:02:58Z	4	Facebook was a very good idea if it was just a social network for friend. In the last two years it lost quality.Now there are many fake people that contact you for spam. Also many many agencies the send you email and messages for spam. I prefer the old facebook, now it seems that it is just a business
Facebook	Peter M.	2012-12-14T17:38:22Z	3	Facebook should never have made public on the stock exchange; way too much focus on earning rather than being the no.1 social media.Further, when so focused on earnings, why are they lacking a proper Windows Phone-app? As social media is their USP, they should be represented equally on all platforms and not just focusing on iPhone and Android.
Facebook	Christopher English	2012-11-22T09:48:35Z	5	I like facebook very much, share photo and everything with my best friends. Many fun.

Facebook	Jacob Gawad	2012-10-25T12:18:18Z	1	Facebook is filled with fraud. all commercials is either fake or fake...They really dont care about users! Only money.Mark Suckerburg wake up now and save your site instead of letting everyone being raped!!!!!!
Facebook	Melissa Hammett Marshall	2012-10-24T04:39:21Z	4	"I say ""I hate Facebook,"" and I kind of do, but it's a great way to see what people are up to, and I'm in several Facebook groups now that are really working well for letting people feel connected. One is a group of old friends who have been out of touch and the other is a place for new people to connect. Facebook works great for both.In addition to people writing random alarming things with no explanation, what I hate is that my family messages on Facebook instead of writing emails, and it seems like half the time the notification doesn't come, so some of us don't know what's going on. It's also unclear which post is being responded to a lot of the time."
Facebook	Leslie Barker	2012-10-18T20:45:25Z	4	I'm all about keeping in touch with friends and family, but I'm not one to post what I'm cooking for dinner.  My biggest complaint about FB is the actual users being idiots on it and not the site/service.  Easy to use and great even for the older family members.... =PI know that some of the Grandparents, Great Grandparents, Aunts and  Uncles above 60 really love to browse the pictures and find it to be really cool they can see new stuff going on even when they're hours or days away.

Facebook	Katie Jackson	2012-09-27T16:44:13Z	3	Facebook was all craze. And so it should have been. Until they put timeline in. I dont think anybody really likes it. Messaging no longer works at 100% sometimes you send a message more than once or not at all. Games on there are good but tbh. Since timeline post people have moved over to twitter.
Facebook	Ryan	2012-09-26T04:16:17Z	4	It's global now, so don't expect to not be bombarded by pictures of babies, meaningless feel-good-quote pics and having nosy people stalk you. Thankfully there are ways to hide most people's ramblings as well as company advertisements and such. Plus side? You can connect to almost every site and app through it.
Facebook	Anders Larsen	2012-09-24T15:50:13Z	1	"Lately I've had tons of problems with the security on my Facebook account, and for some strange reason I haven't been able to change my security settings, nor recieve emails/SMS to verify if I use another browser or computer to log onto my Facebook account. I started researching for ways to fix this problem, but their guides simply don't match anything at all! Therefore I contacted the ""help""-team without any help at all, all they did was simply to copy-paste their guides into the email and send it off. It was simply useless.Horrible security, even more horrible service."
Facebook	Jenna Shuman	2012-09-20T02:38:13Z	4	I am hooked on facebook. The problem is i don't like the adds then run on the side. I also think the games are great. If you dont have facebook get it
Facebook	Sydney Polak	2012-08-29T11:25:07Z	2	I'm using FB everyday, although so many about it bothers me (I think the majority will agree with me that there is just no other option). Don't want the stupid timeline, but they forced everyone to take it. The delete buttons are always hard to find and they publish information that just nobody needs. App is crappy and lots of functions are missing. Most of the times FB needs ages to show me current friend requests or notifications. Lots to improve, they should implement less functions and therefore make the ones that are already there run smootly.

It's part of my daily life and the way my mates and I communicate, however I've noticed recently that the mobile app is getting slower with is frustrating. It's still leagues above everything else and they seem like a far nicer company than power hungry Google, but they could improve it.

Facebook	Chris	2012-07-18T15:21:50Z	3	Facebook is a good tool for staying in touch and interacting with your friends. But the website is becoming increasingly difficult/irritating to use and slow, which has significantly detracted from my experience with it recently.
Facebook	Iain	2012-07-18T14:54:27Z	3	It's ok. When it first hit the scene it was amazing. It was amazing because it was simple. It has become an unwieldy difficult to use site these days. With 'security consciousness' plastered over everything, it's got complicated. I know they have to, I know it's probably the best way of doing it, but it's not fun any more. The games are no longer as good, they all seem the same, rehashed with a blonde girl instead of a dog as the main character. And with plenty of hidden costs to make the companies money. I used to go on religiously.Now Facebook is lucky if I go on once a week. It's mainly because I've been emailed about something happening, and I've not deleted the message has been swamped among those from Facebook telling me that I've not been on for a while.
Facebook	christopher taylor	2012-07-17T23:25:31Z	5	a very good way to keep in touch with friends around the UK.The games keep you occupied during the waiting moments.The instant chat is vety useful.Its a very safe and secure site

Get a life for gods sake!!!! People even broadcast to the world that they are going on holiday for a fortnight and when they get back they find their house has been robbed! Serves 'em right!

Facebook	Sally Ann Simpson	2012-06-16T13:56:35Z	5	Having moved around a lot and had no end of address changes over the years, friends and relatives must have given up on ever staying in contact with me and me likewise, and it didn't help that twice I have lost important address books over the years. So, using the Search on Facebook, I have been able to get in touch with long-lost cousins and aunts, people I went to High School with, people I worked with ages ago and used to do stuff with, and more recent friends as well, this is going back even to the late 1960s and 1970s, so just terrific as I don't think I would have found any of these people any other way than through FB. Cheers!

Hopefully once the niggles have been sorted out it will stay stable."
Facebook	Arwel Roberts	2012-06-15T15:46:53Z	1	Not a site I deal with. I tried it and found adults acting like over grown kids, I cancelled my account and never been back. Someone stole my identity and it took me ages to sort out the mess.

Facebook	John T. Jones	2012-06-15T11:31:00Z	1	No longer use this site as I have found there are people using this site under false pretences. How do they know adults are not posing as children and worse, how do they know children are not posing as adults???? To access this site initially you need to be over 13 years old. Anyone can put in any date of birth but how do they check on it? Be careful who you are talking to.

Facebook	Roisin O'Flaherty	2012-06-08T11:42:53Z	5	Facebook is a very valuable asset to have in my life. Instead of texting people to contact them I can simply drop them a comment or mail and as all young people nowadays seem to check their Facebook on an almost daily basis, whoever I am attempting to contact will see said message briskly!The video-calling feature is also very useful. Being able to contact my friends across the world from the comfort of my home is amazing!

Facebook	hannahmac	2012-06-04T20:01:29Z	1	This website is a waste of time. It is a money making scam and only makes its business by using our personal details to benefit itself. It is taking away valuable time from young students who should be studying rather than wasting valuable time on the computer. The fact that it is classed as 'socialising' is completely poposterous it is the least social and productive thing to spend your time doing. It isn't useful in the slightest, it ruins lives. Until facebook becomes marginally useful i point blank refuse to use it again. I hope people come to the realisation this is a waste of their time. I'm 15 and I believe it is ruining out generation.
Facebook	Jeff Carter	2012-06-04T10:26:30Z	1	Ok, so its a marginally useful tool for keeping in touch with relatives but what a complete and utter waste of time otherwise. I shudder to think how many years of productivity are lost to this.

The chairs were delivered just under a month later in 3 flat packs and took about 2 hours to put together. The ad was therefore misleading. The delivery persons arrived in a beaten up old van and looked rough. When I tried to phone the customer service line to complain the line was dead. I am just glad that the product was fine because I can see lots of potential to get your fingers burnt with this company. AVOID!

Some settings keep defaulting no matter how many times you change them and others change and share your info without you're consent. Sometimes you need to pick your brain to find an answer for the changes and why you can't see you're own info. Had too many changes in a short period of time.

Facebook	Gary	2012-05-09T07:59:40Z	2	Too many add ons, apps, adverts and changes. Great to just keep in touch with friends, but the overall feel for me is that it has it has gone too big. It also doesn't listen to it's users as so many don't like the Timeline feature.
Facebook	Rob Adams	2012-05-08T13:47:03Z	1	Facebook is great for finding friends from long ago, but the reason they are friends from long ago is because you chose that!No more facebook, just bring back real conversations and social life

Facebook	Samantha	2012-05-02T20:10:45Z	1	I hate this site. It's nosy and irritating and people seem to think having 500 'friends' is somehow clever. I would chose one, decent non internet friend over a page full of strangers and people I don't even like any day and the games are utter trash. I also hate seeing the blue F plastered everywhere. I just really hate the site!

Can't delete multiple friends right now, so you can't cull your 'friends' but hey ho.

Facebook	Katherine Cleaver	2012-04-28T10:15:09Z	2	I use facebook as it is a free way to contact people and find old friends, I also play a few games.Unfortunately they have let themselves down by making too many changes which no one really wants.It also uses alot of memory which means it slows computers down and even causes my reasonably new computer to crash occasionaly.

Facebook	Arthur	2012-04-24T07:37:44Z	4	I started using facebook in 2008 . The thought of sharing photos , videos and ideas appealed to me since I moved abroad and wanted to keep in touch with my family and friends and since it also made them part of my experiences (well those who are interested anyway) . Since the start of facebook a few years ago , they have improved the functionality and usability of their services through innovative thinking and whilst it is great to have been the at the top of breaking new ground one wonders how much longer the company will be able to break such new ground in the future . With the growing size the company has probably lost some maneuverability when it comes to rolling out new ideas and now that facebook wants to be listed as a public company one wonders when the ideas of big stake holders will ultimately overtake that of the founder in his vision of keeping facebook a free to use service .

Otherwise find it difficult to use, drives me mad with suggestive friends who I have never even heard of let alone want to know.  Hate silly messages but don't want to offend friends by telling them so, thus hide their posts.  Cannot understand why friends who want to send me an important message don't email me.  Facebook is an enormous time waster.  Very occasionally something interesting posted, usually photos.

I do not object to adverts appearing there, they are not a charity, but the bombardment of gimmick and add ons which - if you click on them want to know who all your friends/contacts are , is disturbing. I do not want some anonymous machine  knowing what I am up to, what my likes/dislikes are etc. Keep it simple and you will be fine. Click on theses gimmick and - well you have been warned.

Facebook	Gwedelin	2012-04-09T16:55:53Z	2	I don't like face book their security isn't very good. There are a few instances when I've had to report people who were obviously not real. The messages which I received were quite explicit so I don't understand why Facebook didn't see these messages as soon as they came on their site. I'm not going to use them again as it's quite a dangerous site to use especially when you're adding personal details about yourself.
Facebook	Ian Welch	2012-04-08T18:09:10Z	1	I keep getting blocked for adding people on a site that is supposedly all about social networking and making new friends.  Add to that the fact i get no response from the system administrators despite numerous emails & messages via Facebook, it makes me want to leave the site altogether and use Twitter instead as they seem to have more of an understanding of how to deal with their users on a one-to-one basis rather than being a faceless entity.......

Facebook	Glyn	2012-04-07T06:08:44Z	3	I was pulled into Facebook by an email from someone who wanted me to be his 'friend'. He was already my friend, so I had no idea what he was going on about, however I followed the link, intending to give him some click to confirm rather than ignore him, but found I actually had to Join the thing to do so. I was tempted to phone him to say 'nothing personal, but you're going to have to accept that i am your friend, without my having to join some official club in order to prove it to you'.However, I decided to join, in the unlikely event that it might be in any way of interest to me. That seemed to put me on some kind of a map, and I was soon getting emails from more people wanting me to be their 'friend'. Each time, I had to find and apply my login details in order to validate the friendship I thought they already had with me. After a few months, these interruptions began to dwindle, and I only have to log in about once every three months.Occasionally, I am told that people have 'written things on my wall', so I log in. It is a lot of effort to do things which can more easily be done by phone, email or forum. Worse still, I seem to be in the centre of irrelevant, even idiotic information trying to grap my attention of my clicks. Somebody was desperate to get a virtual ingredient to make a virtual cocktail in order to get a virtual-bartenders' certificate. What collyrot! But I wincingly and, I admit, patronizingly decided to click to assist them in their pointless ambition; and found that to do so, I had to liberate my entire address book to the organizers of the virtual bar, presumably so that I become implicated in spreading this.Therefore, I go on Facebook only when I am called, am unimpressed each time, and I log off ASAP.There are, however, many millions of people who like spending time on it - it obviously 'works'. Even some of my real-life friends tell me that it helps them to 'keep in touch'.When reviewing, I typically feel secure and confident that I am assessing the quality of a 'thing in itself'. But, regarding Facebook, I realise I am reviewing a product which works, but which I have no interest in, like a chicken-sexing kit. The serious difference between Facebook and chicken-sexing kits, both of which, I assume, achieve their objectives, is that the latter does not force itself into my awareness, nor recruit my friends to be part of its marketing.

Facebook	Gabrielle Hall	2012-04-04T17:11:33Z	3	Facebook is a good tool for getting in touch with people, posting updates or photos to inform people what you are up to. Facebook is part of the young generation, and can be useful to get in contact with people quickly through facebook chat. Since I've had facebook, I never get any problems. Sometimes, I noticed that some pages have been liked without my consent which is not a problem but it can be annoying. Once, you've had a facebook for a while, it can become boring and you would tend to go on less and less which is inevitable.

So if you’re into film and your Facebook page reflects that then you'll be inundated with adverts for film...I’m not so keen on Facebook now funnily enough!

Facebook	Richard	2012-03-27T17:36:47Z	3	I only use Facebook because I have to. It is not an experience I enjoy. It's like queuing up at the cinema to buy a drink, knowing you're about to get a good rogering by the cinema staff for what is essentially water (free) and sugar (next to free). But, you're there to have a 'good time', and your friends are looking on, and maybe you even have a date so it would look weird if you didn't get a drink.I mean, sure, people would understand, and they would say 'oh no, its good that you didn't - they're not good value' but they still think you're weird. And such is the same of Facebook.Everyone is Facebook, everything happens on Facebook, I can't imagine a Facebookless life simply because its where I talk to my friends, acquaintences, find out about goings on and generally keep up with social circle. I use google+ too, which is fun, but it doesn't have the adoption required to be a required website.So, what's wrong with facebook? It can be slow, a lot of the time. It can be buggy, a lot of the time. Whenever I chat to someone, I need to close the browser and reopen it every 5 or 6 minutes, because its crashed the process. Yet my google talk in gmail can be left on all day.I don't like the lack of transparency or the cognition of privacy on facebook. They basically say 'The settings are there! It's up to you!' but they ASSUME that you want to share. This means, if you absent mindedly click (like 90% of people), you will end up sharing fairly quickly. It's like the opt-in / opt-out organ donor debate. Except, giving facebook the right to share my stuff is less high on the priority list than giving little Jimmy what's left of my retinas after I succumb to a horrible but thankfully brief death at the hands of an overworked and underpaid bus driver who wasn't looking the right way at the right time.Facebook works. I use it every day because I don't have an alternative.But I don't like it.

Facebook	Shepard Ofpeace	2012-03-24T20:20:05Z	2	Your privacy options and policies are not clear and warnings of social media use should be posted for young adults and newcomers.Your friendship policy is weird.  I can have my friendship privilege turned off for befriending someone I don't know.  That is weird, what business is it of yours and how do you know and why are we not given the option refute this?If my friends and family weren't on facebook I wouldn't be either.  What will you do when we all decide to go elsewhere?
Facebook	Peter Galgut	2012-03-24T14:32:51Z	3	When I get an email from them telling me about sometyhing that may be of interest I delete it as I can't be bothered to go through the signing in process to access the information. I simply dodn't have the time for this nonesence. If they are worried about security, and so they should be there are other more streamlined ways of insuring that I am the correct person without this inconvenience. I therefore seldom visit the site.
Facebook	Matevž Špacapan	2012-03-23T18:11:42Z	4	It's a nice site that I visit to pass the time :)However sometimes there's just too much too see on there
Facebook	CJK	2012-03-23T10:05:38Z	2	While Facebook is fine for basic keeping in touch with families and friends, the site is plagued my never happy designers who seem to want to change anything and everything about the site. The problem being most of the changes are unwanted and unneeded and occasionally are worse than the previous design. The new timeline is a mess of a layout and the previous update just as bad. Facebook would benefit a lot if they just left it alone. As it is, the constant meddling really puts me off using the site, the majority of users seem to dislike many of the bad choices but Facebook do not listen. A poorly run site, with frequent but unnecessary changes is not how you keep people happy.
Facebook	Clive Walley	2012-03-23T09:42:41Z	1	Just when you feel that you are settled with this account you suddenly find the layout, the rules and how they use you for developing sales contact lists to sell on to merchendisers makes me suspicious of the true motives of this company.

Facebook	Martin Crane	2012-03-20T18:27:31Z	1	Being an elderly person I suppose I must be old fashioned. But I try to avoid Facebook like a plague. I am most baffled by the lazy computer speak so have problems trying to understand what is being said. But I completely object to the foul language that is so liberal on all pages. I find it most offensive and unwelcome. It should not be allowed but I blame the relaxed censorship rules for film and television some must get paid by the number of times they can swear.

Facebook	emma wingfield	2012-03-20T00:52:55Z	4	facebook is a well displayed and informated site. It has help buttons easy to get to and many different apps and ways to communicate with your family and friends. Only bad thing is its not 100% sure to be safe. would reccomend tho, just be carefull in what you do ,say and put on there.
Facebook	Judi Martin	2012-03-19T09:22:46Z	4	I've been on facebook about 20 months or so now, and I wouldn't be without it. However, I do only use it as I want to, and never get drwn into games, etc, etc, or spend too long on it. I love seeing friends pictures, catching up with their news, and wishing people Happy Birthday etc, and that is how I see facebook's worth for me.
Facebook	Nick the Herb Toker	2012-03-19T09:13:40Z	1	"A poisonous site, avoid at all costs. A breeding ground for cyber-bullying, hate crime, racial abuse and phaedophilia. How many times do you hear on ""The Jeremy Kyle Show"" ""You f***ing said on Facebook...."". And that's the bottom line cos Stone Cold said so!"
Facebook	Elena Ashton	2012-03-18T14:25:50Z	2	"I love Facebook so so do I only give it two stars? A number of reasons.1  Without Members, Facebook would not exist. Yet they treat members with contempt. Their system prompts me to add new suggested users but when I do, they stop me by saying I don't know them. In some cases, this happens despite me having 7 or 8 mutual friends with that person.2   One of my friends sent a ""friend request"" to someone she thought she knew. That person reported her and my friend was banned for a week from making any friend requests. No chance to explain or anything, just treated her with contempt.3   Worst of all, there are many business pages who use Facebook to gain new customers and then scam them. These sites use images that breach copyright and they block anybody who posts a negative comment or asks a question they don't like. While we can be blocked and scammed by these businesses, there is no way on Facebook for us to report these companies who abuse Facebook. So Facebook has become a tool for these businesses to cheat people and we have no voice. Facebook is great and I love it but they need to remember that it would be nothing without it's members."

Facebook	Jake	2012-03-17T18:55:48Z	3	I know that people are generally opposed to change in all forms, but in facebook's case I think that user opposition is justified. Layout and feature overhauls aren't uncommon, and after they are introduced it doesn't seem to matter what people think - the changes are permanent. They could do well by listening to feedback.Other than that, it is a solid social networking site. They'll probably stay on top for a long time, but the way that they're running things is giving plenty of opportunities for better sites to swiftly take away their users.

Facebook	Christina Walker	2012-02-13T11:45:43Z	3	The site itself is a good idea and reasonably easy to navigate after a while however the constant changes with lack of respect for what the users want is disgraceful. Especially with the new 'timeline' major changes that affect the users are forced upon them and make the site confusing and annoying however it is still a good place to connect to friends you can't see in person a lot.
Facebook	Simon Edwards	2012-02-13T02:01:57Z	3	as alot of people know this is a stalkers paradise when privacy settings aren't scanned and changed.but the site efficiency is good for marketing an making contacts for company's.but alot of the time its used as tool for checking up on people and misused to a social advantage of the persons wills.E.g cyber bullying etc.but as a site for social interaction is good but too many people use it every day for useless activity's and displaying far too much information about a person witch is so easily obtained.

Facebook	Ahmet	2012-02-12T00:16:11Z	5	There is more to Facebook than most users know. The code and structure behind the site is something that most web developers would dream to create.Many have tried to copy Facebook, but all will fail. Something really big needs to happen to even think about taking on Facebook!
Facebook	Louis	2012-02-11T14:49:05Z	4	Pretty much the only way to get in touch with people you've lost contact with!Not happy that they keep updating it with silly features like timeline that people don't actually want!
Facebook	Ben Thomas	2012-02-11T11:10:19Z	2	As much as I have a facebook account, and regularly use it, it is only because  I have  to, to stay in contact with people! Too many people live  their lives on facebook and it is a shame.

Facebook	Lisa Briggs Hardy	2012-02-07T20:21:12Z	4	I use facebook on a daily basis. It has it's good and bad sides. They are difficult to contact if you have a complaint, and I wish they wouldn't keep changing things on the site, like the timeline and the group pages.It is a great medium for reconnecting with old friends, and for me a great way to keep in touch with my family in the US when I am in the UK.
Facebook	Mrs G Crooks derbyshire	2012-02-07T07:50:59Z	2	Facebook is a phenomenon  of the century , but they need to make sure that they look after the millions of us who play games on their site, Farmville crashes constantly, citiville was so bad I stopped playing it , and if you read the game feeds on line people are getting absolutely fed up with the constant upping of prices to complete tasks Etc ... Poor customer service, especially to loyal gamers.
Facebook	Frank M. Lange.	2012-02-06T23:09:19Z	1	It took me 10 minutes - after registering - to realize, that facebook is useless and timerobbing.It took me almost 2 days to get all my info removed and my account canceled.Facebook? NO thank you. Real life please.
Facebook	Mike Roberts	2012-02-06T15:43:32Z	1	I have pretty much stopped using FB, this used to be quite good but recently they have imposed to many changes and I get of of synch updates all the time.   Good for storing pictures, otherwise I don't really use it anymore.

Facebook	Customer	2012-02-03T12:59:50Z	3	No need for all the changes just as you get used to it they go mess it up again. Don;t use it as much because of this. Extremely hard to contact company about anything they do not respond they take no notice of peoples complaints and YOU CANNOT LEAVE!!! You can deactivate but you can't leave permanently
Facebook	Michael Angelo	2012-02-03T04:10:45Z	3	Since it is the #1 social network however with all their take it or leave it makeovers and the serious lack of privacy, their needs to better privacy settings, and the possible hacking by anonymous it does raise concerns how your life is being displayed for all to see.
Facebook	Michael Crane	2012-02-02T13:02:57Z	2	I reckon FB is a fantastic way to keep in touch with family and friends, but getting to grips with its ever-changing Privacy options is a pain! It is hard to keep up with the settings and trying to keep non-friends from seeing your content is like herding cats - nigh impossible! And now we have Timeline! It is awful and hard to see what is going on and with whom. Almost everything I've done on FB is there, going back to the day I joined; and I'm sure there's content therein I'd rather not have repeated, but I have to read every bit of it to delete the bits I'd like to be rid of; and frankly, I haven't the will to get to grips with yet another 'improvement'.So, I'll continue trying to remember to mark my comments 'friends' until that new Google thingy entices me away.
Facebook	Victor	2012-01-31T21:07:08Z	4	Facebook is a really good homepage, and many people all over the world use it. But the new timeline i crap. And sometimes they come up with a new chatsystem to learn, after you have just learnt the last system. Sad for an amazing site

Facebook	E Clark	2012-01-26T20:54:54Z	1	Unless you are leaving a status update, FB is so hard to use for anything else. Tried advertising business on it - hard work. Just find it frustrating so stopped using it. Back to Google ....
Facebook	Tessa	2012-01-26T12:21:43Z	1	I think this is a sinister website and people need to be very careful what they share.  Heaven only knows what information is floating in cyber space about all these people with so many 'Friends'

Facebook	Stephen Davids	2012-01-20T22:12:42Z	2	"Let's ""face"" it.  Most of the stuff we put on facebook is quite boring, unless you are really interested in peeping into other people's lives, or showing off your own.  And it seems a lot of people are - for now.But where is this leading us?  I think many will tire of this fad of writing a diary for the world to read and view, as it becomes so pervasive that we become numb to the information flow.And what happens to the revealing bits we expose of our lives when we don't want people to remember them?  They will still exist in some archive somewhere waiting for a skilled researcher to dig them up and torture us with what we once said we felt or said we did.The security is not great, the quality is not great, I think the future is not great for these services either.  Let's see."
Facebook	John	2012-01-19T17:54:17Z	1	I just don't get it. Why does everyone want to use an Internet within the Internet, especially one that opens you up to so much potential abuse?Shows what fantastic marketing can do with a load of sheep. Baaa!

Searching for old friends now is just impossible without knowing their shoe and waist size it seems,what happened to the old function of just putting in the name and their town?I tend to use it less now as I find it a bit frustrating,but when I do go online and chat with my friends its great.Come on Facebook,if a record is'nt broke why change it

Facebook	Micke	2012-01-09T16:09:01Z	1	Facebook went from being a social media site that allowed everyone to connect in a simple, easy way. It was great. Then they went and started allowing games, apps, etc etc. I understand it's funded through advertising, and that's great. I actually have used some of the ads to get things I need -- new climbing equipment, a tent -- but there is just too much other crap going on. Not to mention all the new looks, all the styles everything is more complicated. Facebook had a great model. I hope that they can find a way to get back to it.

Facebook	Steve Pennington	2012-01-02T21:18:23Z	3	I remember the first time I logged in to Facebook, amazingly just 4-5 years ago or so and was intrigued by the concept, it was all so new but was also still in it's infancy so I soon lost interest and didn't visit it again for over a year!When I did log back on I saw that the site had evolved massively and was much more than just an half-hour interest visit to check on Zombie or Vampire challenges or some such gubbins. It had become a genuine 'Social Network'.Clearly, fast evolution is required in any early E-Project if it's to grow and survive in such a competitive world but after a while you simply have to STOP TWATTING about with it! You listening Zuckerberg? I am utterly threaders with having to relearn where everything is every few months, and as for you deciding what you think I might find important, well...you ain't God dude.Let your baby go man, improve by all means in the back-end but leave the front bits alone. If you don't, as soon as a viable alternative comes along, everyone will jump ship. I've been looking at Twitter but it's sh!t.Maybe I should come up with my own...Craniumkindle maybe!! ;-)Seriously though...leave it alone now!!

Facebook	Customer Nyree Wadman	2011-12-20T15:13:25Z	4	It's invaluable for a cattered family, especially once we've all got the Social Fixer application working to control the flood of commercial and other rubbish.  Constant changes are unwelcome but can be reversed with the Social Fixer application.  Being able to 'stream' various groups and categories of interest is valuable, as is the ability to upload photos and link to videos and music.  One thing I would NEVER do, though, is assume that it's free from hackers. I make sure NEVER to link Facebook to other internet activities and sites, and I am very vigilant about the amount of information I place there - even with full privacy controls in place, I would never, for example, be stupid enough to give my correct birthdate - identity thieves are everywhere.   I do not link my Facebook account to anything else I do online, particularly my email accounts.   I don't like being 'all joined up'.  It's not safe or courteous, to lay my email contacts open to being blattered with Facebook-generated communications.

Yet over time I can't help feeling it's just utter sh*t.  Apologies for swearing.If people want to contact me, pick up a bloody telephone or email me, I don't bite. Don't send me a sodding 'feed my pet request' or some other inane crap. I have better things to do with my life. Security has been another issue over the years with Facebook, something which seems to have been addressed latterly, but I still can't help feeling why would you want everyone to know your business?!?

Facebook	Kees	2011-11-18T09:27:15Z	2	It's a shame that the social community site with such a poor interface won the ratrace for the biggest - use it all the time but it's often annoying. Unclear interface, no restyling-opportunities, annoying junction between mails and chat, replys on mail are automatically reply-alls, groups are virtually useless, can't turn notifications for individual threads on and off, etc etc.

I'm on facebook every day.Perfect site to get in contact with old friend, you haven't seen for some years, and of course in contact with your current friends.Now the bad things:- Changes layout too often!!- I can't see who's online on the profile, my chat is just loading.. -.-- Sometimes it's slow.

Even after selecting the privacy requests, it is still a problem. I do not feel that Facebook s particularly safe to use and has been many the cause of arguments from people that I know.

Facebook	BRISTOW	2011-10-17T11:39:43Z	1	Human interaction, personal information, private conversations...a den of iniquity a haven for abuse and a place to demoralize and interact with like for like morons.Facebook is the faceless interaction Bullying engine...where abuse and abused are taunted and then in a flash everything is deleted.There is no room for truth on the internet...FB is the indirect source that governments worldwide can use to monitor us all! Social interaction and relationships are human not electronic...no wonder that society has become inward they have forgotten how to act outward! Boycott the FB it's a secret organization implemented by governments to watch the unwatchable!

Facebook	Starr Tompko	2011-10-11T19:26:35Z	5	I have been with facebook for almost 2yrs now & i can tell you they are the best social site for adults to visit to connect w/ friends,have a business page & ect...They are continuely updating there privacy policies for the protection of all. They are also constantly updating there system in general to make it better with all the improvements.The only thing when it comes to business pages i do not like is there pay-per click ads because that is not helpful or benficial to business owners. Thats like saying we are helping your business prosper inless there's something in it for us- not cool!I also don't like in there marketplace they put a limit on the # of products you can list. I use these business services through facebook daily. I do think those services need improving.

Facebook	kiran	2011-10-03T16:57:22Z	3	The privacy settings are really awkward now as its harder not to share everything with everyone... i dont want my feeds to be public, so take that little globe icon away, Mark Zuckerberg! Just cos you like to share everything doesnt mean that we do. Facebook should be for sharing with who you want. the fact that usernames cant be changed more than once means that people can look me up by my username if they cant find me in public searches! P.A.N.T.S

Facebook	SkyDarkwater	2011-09-16T00:43:02Z	4	Facebook is, of course, a great way to stay connected with friends and family.  The only problem with it is that there isn't a way to filter out all the game requests.  It can mean hunting through requests for game pieces to find out what people are actually saying.  And if you play the games, be prepared to spend actual money.  More and more games require regular use of Facebook Credits.

Facebook	Cris	2011-08-16T14:41:47Z	3	I'm not always on Facebook because it is NOT user friendly at all.  I guess the reason people like the site is just because of social networking.  It is very cumbersome to use and hard to tell what and where I need to be to find things people have sent me.  I use it just because others do.  It would be great if it was more user friendly.

Cos, you WON'T be able to pretend your kids are made of sugar, your spouse is straight out of a fairy tale and your holiday and wedding snaps beat the royals any day. Also if you are a female aged 60+ pls don't join, as you won't comprehend that EVERYONE YOU ADD (and some public members) can read EVERYTHING on your wall posts. ie ""Hi Mavis, I had my pile operation,  my ringer isn't so sore now, sitting on an ice pack, Bill can't have anal for a few weeks, hope you are well, write back soon, much love Jean xx "" it isn't exactly private! But they dont know how to bloody use it!! Random  faces that come up of friends of friends? You get bombarded with friends of friends ie folk you will never meet in a lifetime . You will be bombarded with requests from weirdos! Some will shock you with their racism and filth, and you will never be done reporting and blocking the idiots! Also, you get sent send stupid game requests and childish quizzes across to you and access all your info. I LOVE IT lol cos am  constantly prying and am astounded by everything people willingly reveal. They happily share their name age where they stay and even phone number and places of work and kids pics and not even hidden. dates of birth, times they were born, holidays they are on, great for burglars and fakers of ID!WOW,  didnt even know my next door neighbour was doing half the stuff those naughty pics tsk tsk, hope his boss doesnt find the ones with Wotsits up each nostril!

However, if something goes wrong with any of the functions on their website be warned you will be waiting a long time for the issue to be addressed. To act as a buffer to the many people having problems, Facebook has a help section. This is an area for people to post website issues and await a reply from someone who can help. Threads go unanswered for weeks, months, years....

I connect with lost friends and get a glimpse of what's going on in their lives as if they are right next door.  There is so much to do there, thus the universal appeal.  It's addicting to some and there are some nasty viruses you can get when you click undiscriminately.  If you're careful, you can't beat this social networking site.

Facebook	Alex Shaun	2011-07-20T11:42:25Z	5	Best social network where you can communicate and find almost all your friends, with great addicting games online.
Facebook	Blanche White	2011-07-20T07:50:35Z	5	though facebook, i find many friends in the same camp , i like it so much
Facebook	PW-J	2011-07-19T21:06:57Z	1	Decent for communicating with people in other countries but otherwise irrelevant and wasting a lot of people's time

Facebook	Flight Fares	2011-07-13T12:43:17Z	4	I like this website. it is very usefull to advertise of websites and other products.
Facebook	kathryn - customer	2011-07-12T17:24:45Z	3	i no longer have facebook, as it causes many problems. including, people can get brave and be very mean and personal towards people and not want to say it in person. i find this very off putting. facebook can also be good because you are in contact with friends and family that you may not be otherwise available to contact.
Facebook	Jamie	2011-07-11T22:23:26Z	5	Simple easy and much better than the news makes it seem.
Facebook	Brandon	2011-07-11T15:56:28Z	3	did not like facebook too much, many of the features seem broken or are not explained clearly, e.g. you need 25 likes before you can have a username but I found that out on another website. Also is the number of hoops you have to jump through to do things. I think Facebook is overly hyped.

Facebook	Jahangir Alom	2011-07-05T18:05:28Z	1	I'm very dissapointed on how facebook treats religion, they allow users to abuse other religions as they want. They deserve a lawsuit!
Facebook	Jack	2011-07-04T16:44:51Z	4	I often use Facebook, its a great way to let people know what your doing, organise events and meet new people. There are afew bugs on the website and features which you cant get around or turn off. Also the fact that when they add a new feature you automatically get the emails sent to you anc have to turn them off in your account settings is irritating. There are alos problems and bugs with the facebook iphone app, but the bugs are reported to facebook via the app store
Facebook	Allan David Brown	2011-07-04T16:27:38Z	5	This is 1 of the best social sites I have been on in a while

Facebook	Alma Flores-Huerte	2011-06-20T15:51:15Z	1	I am not so satisfied with this site. Although it allows me to share my thoughts, photos, or videos to my friends, there are some issues like the site lags from time to time. I also experience too much spamming from people I don't know. I am also afraid that I could get a spyware or malware when I open my Facebook. I hope the developers look into this more deeper and correct any bugs and issues, so that users will be more confident using it.
Facebook	Jessieloola	2011-06-19T17:57:25Z	5	I'd lost touch with my best friend, and when she found me through facebook we met up. We're now closer than ever and I guess I have to thank facebook for that!
Facebook	steve guest	2011-06-16T07:39:56Z	3	good site to find old friends but at times goes silent too many distractions of apps and games gone too much for money than users. still gets too many glitches on the system and too much of messages that hack your friends address's this needs to be sorted
Facebook	Dan Martin	2011-05-20T10:11:11Z	3	I am, like most teens - on facebook. I make about 10 posts every day (much to the digression of my friends) about everything ranging from my day at college, quotes, music, film - all sorts. Ive been using the service since late-2008 and have watched the many updates.The problem with Facebook is it keeps wanting to 'tamper' with itself - which is just making it worse, and terrible to use. Instead of looking at making the website run faster, produce less errors etc they seem to find it more useful to introduce futile additions such as 'the light box' (or Theatre mode for viewing picture) or changing the layout of my newsfeed etc.There are so many problems with Facebook; I question why 'we' all use it still. I understand its such a hive of activity; but so is Google - and they don't seem to have a problem (thinking of all their services Mail, Search, Checkout, Translate, Maps, Picasa, Buzz etc.) ?Im not the only one to think this. On a postive note; it has revolutionized how we all communicate with each other - and everything which used to be seen as 'private' ends up on Facebook, and  we are now communicating with each other 24 hours of a day. Being able to 'look through the keyhole' at other peoples lives..... it is an astonishing thing Facebook - its just so broken.If Facebook are reading this; then here's my message.Ok, you've sorted out the privacy (great thanks for that by the way :) ), but now can you look to sorting out the stability and performance of your website? Instead of tinkering with stupid things that no-one wants, and look crass (i.e. light-box).
Facebook	Adi Levy	2011-05-16T15:22:28Z	5	The one and only - great interface, great service , fair security , lots of options - the king of social networks !
Facebook	sam	2011-04-27T11:02:47Z	3	When the phenomenon that is Facebook hit the world, people hastily joined, leaving many a myspace and Bebo account to gather dust. Even mum, nan and fido eventually got in on the action. Now I'm all for networking but when I log in and see the same people online all the time, it makes me laugh. Along with attention seeking statuses and constant farmville updates from friends, it can annoy you. Although statuses such as 'I might top myself tonight' or 'I wish I wasn't alone =(' are humorous, it eventually stops being funny.Overall it's good for photos, events and remembering birthdays. On the flip side - shitty online games, friend hoarding and the urge to punch some people - not so good. You only need to use once daily, twice if you're desperate. Any more and you need to get a life. As for myself, weekly will suffice.
Facebook	Clever Boxes	2011-04-07T17:16:55Z	4	Social networking at it's best Thankscleverboxes.com
Facebook	Lewis	2011-04-06T22:55:56Z	3	brilliant socailing network, mostly for the younger generation. For a catch up , or a update on your friends here's the place to check, could improve the chat application as it is not the most reliable
Facebook	Chayon Sinha	2011-04-05T04:24:05Z	4	Best way to keep in touch with friendsalso great tool to network with other and also finding you old friends
Facebook	Lisa & Huw Davies	2011-03-21T10:02:01Z	3	A great way to get back in touch with old work and school friends! Make sure your privacy settings are in place to safeguard your personal security! Dont dissclose TOO MUCH personal information on your page and always make sure that your kids are supervised whilst using this site!

Facebook	audiogeek99	2010-11-12T20:31:01Z	5	This site is addictive.  You find yourself logging in every day to find out what your friends are up to and playing games. A very good free service for keeping in touch with friends etc.
Facebook	G. Decle	2010-09-25T16:50:07Z	4	all was well , no problems
Facebook	Chellie	2010-05-19T06:21:36Z	4	Facebook is an excellent way to catch up with friends or just talk about school work.  It seems a lot safer than MySpace, and fairly easy to use.The only drawback is that a lot of people use Facebook to spam or to advertise their own webpage, which is annoying.  The previous reviewer mentioned viruses, and although I have never experienced that aspect of Facebook, people should probably take caution anyway.
Facebook	Soap Bar	2010-05-17T01:39:28Z	2	some lead to viruses
Facebook	Devil Some	2010-03-18T20:21:09Z	5	I have got back my childhood friends whom i lost. A good communication media, easy social relation...

Facebook	Frederik Buhl Kristensen	2009-12-28T15:31:51Z	2	Facebook has a lot of very good features that come in very handy in the every day life. BUT(!) it is a very sad and offensive fact that once you've joined Facebook, you can't delete your personal facts again. Facebook will always have the right to use them. What is even worse is that you don't even have to have an account yourself for Facebook to get pictures of you. If one of your mates decide to post a picture of you (even if you don't even know what Facebook is), Facebook has the right to use it forever. So in spite of Facebook's very good features, it is so offensive to people's privacy that I think it is an attack on human rights.
Facebook	john shambrook	2009-12-08T09:23:45Z	5	Takes up most of your day if not careful. As you can play games & chat all on one site. Although it is of great importance you read all the setting you allow programs to run. So check the applications setting page to set allow or block. Some are completely harmless some aren't so. Other than that a good site.
Facebook	Philip Smith	2009-09-15T11:53:55Z	3	Wiith a large consumer base... Facebook need to invest in more powerful servers.They just can't cope during peak time.

Facebook	Sean Houlihane	2009-03-18T19:30:53Z	1	Facebook have removed the ability to control which applications post feeds to my home page, so all I see now is junk. Even blocking the app has no effect, I have resorted to blocking some people from my news feed.
